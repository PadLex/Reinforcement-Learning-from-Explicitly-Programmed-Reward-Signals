"input": "4x8 board. Two counters in each hole. Opening play:  Players rearrange their counters so that there are four counters in each hole of their outer row. If they play with the second array, they take turns sowing from each of the holes with four  counters, beginning with the rightmost hole, placing two in the first hole and one in each of the following. Main phase: Play begins from any hole on the player's side of the board with counters in it. Singletons cannot move. Sowing happens in an anti-clockwise direction. If the last counter lands in an empty hole, the turn is over. For capturing: Holes are in 'opposition' when one player has the front row hole occupied and the opponent has both of the holes opposite it occupied. If the last hole in a sowing is in opposition, the player takes the counters in both of the opponent's holes and places them in the empty hole from which the player lifted the counters. The player then sows the captured counters from this hole. Further captures in the sowing can occur in the same way. However, each player has two hole from which clockwise plays can be made: the leftmost hole in the outer row and the second from the left in the inner row. Clockwise moves can only be made from these holes if they immediately lead to a capture. When the captured counters are sown, starting from the same hole, they can also be sown clockwise if they lead to a capture. If they cannot lead to a capture, they are sown anti-clockwise. Another alternative the player has is that, if the player plays clockwise from one of these holes and therefore makes a capture, the captured counters may be placed in the hole and left there, and the player may play instead from the other hole from which clockwise captures are allowed in a clockwise direction, if it leads to a capture. The player may continue playing from this hole as above until the possibilities to move are exhausted, and then may move from any hole in an anti-clockwise direction. Multiple captures can only be made in a clockwise direction from these holes if it is made on the first sowing of the turn. Otherwise, only one clockwise capture can be made and sowing must proceed in an anti-clockwise direction. If the last counter lands on a hole that is occupied but not in opposition, these counters are picked up and sowing continues. Play ends when one player captures all the opponent's counters or one player cannot play. The player who cannot play loses. A player may also win by capturing the counters from both of the opponent's end holes in the inner row in a single turn.         ",

"input": "4x8 board. Two counters in each hole. Opening play: Two players play simultaneously, lifting and sowing counters from their outer rows. Rules for sowing and capturing are the same as in the main phase of the game except that all holes in each player's outer rows are considered to be in opposition and back captures can be made from them. Once a counter has been sown into the inner row, this ceases and captures can only be made from the inner row. The opening ends when both players reach an empty hole, and the first player to do so begins play in the main phase.                           Main phase: Play begins from any hole on the player's side of the board with counters in it. Singletons cannot move. Sowing happens in an anti-clockwise direction. If the last counter lands in an empty hole, the turn is over                          For capturing: Holes are in 'opposition' when one player has the front row hole occupied and the opponent has both of the holes opposite it occupied. If the last hole in a sowing is in opposition, the player takes the counters in both of the opponent's holes and places them in the empty hole from which the player lifted the counters. The player then sows the captured counters from this hole. Further captures in the sowing can occur in the same way. However, each player has two holes from which clockwise plays can be made: the leftmost hole in the outer row and the second from the left in the inner row. Clockwise moves can only be made from these holes if they immediately lead to a capture. When the captured counters are sown, starting from the same hole, they can also be sown clockwise if they lead to a capture. If they cannot lead to a capture, they are sown anti-clockwise.                           Another alternative the player has is that, if the player plays clockwise from one of these holes and therefore makes a capture, the captured counters may be placed in the hole and left there, and the player may play instead from the other hole from which clockwise captures are allowed in a clockwise direction, if it leads to a capture.                           The player may continue playing from this hole as above until the possibilities to move are exhausted, and then may move from any hole in an anti-clockwise direction. Multiple captures can only be made in a clockwise direction from these holes if it is made on the first sowing of the turn. Otherwise, only one clockwise capture can be made and sowing must proceed in an anti-clockwise direction. If the last counter lands on a hole that is occupied but not in opposition, these counters are picked up and sowing continues.                       Play ends when one player captures all the opponent's counters or one player cannot play. The player who cannot play loses.",

"input": "4x8 board. Two counters in each hole. Opening play: Two players play simultaneously, lifting and sowing counters from their outer rows. Rules for sowing and capturing are the same as in the main phase of the game. Sowing cannot begin from the fourth or fifth hole from the left in the player's outer hole. Players play until both drop the final counter in an empty hole, the first to do so plays first in the main phase. Players then move alternately.  Main phase: Play begins from any hole on the player's side of the board with counters in it. Singletons cannot move. Sowing happens in an anti-clockwise direction. If the last counter lands in an empty hole, the turn is over. For capturing: Holes are in 'opposition' when one player has the front row hole occupied and the opponent has both of the holes opposite it occupied. If the last hole in a sowing is in opposition, the player takes the counters in both of the opponent's holes and places them in the empty hole from which the player lifted the counters. The player then sows the captured counters from this hole. Further captures in the sowing can occur in the same way. However, each player has two hole from which clockwise plays can be made: the leftmost hole in the outer row and the second from the left in the inner row. Clockwise moves can only be made from these holes if they immediately lead to a capture. When the captured counters are sown, starting from the same hole, they can also be sown clockwise if they lead to a capture. If they cannot lead to a capture, they are sown anti-clockwise. Another alternative the player has is that, if the player plays clockwise from one of these holes and therefore makes a capture, the captured counters may be placed in the hole and left there, and the player may play instead from the other hole from which clockwise captures are allowed in a clockwise direction, if it leads to a capture. The player may continue playing from this hole as above until the possibilities to move are exhausted, and then may move from any hole in an anti-clockwise direction. Multiple captures can only be made in a clockwise direction from these holes if it is made on the first sowing of the turn. Otherwise, only one clockwise capture can be made and sowing must proceed in an anti-clockwise direction. If the last counter lands on a hole that is occupied but not in opposition, these counters are picked up and sowing continues. Play ends when one player captures all the opponent's counters or one player cannot play. The player who cannot play loses. A player may also win by capturing the counters from both of the opponent's end holes in the inner row in a single turn.",

For capturing: four holes are in opposition when one player has the front row hole occupied and the opponent has both of the holes opposite it occupied. If the last hole in a sowing is in opposition, the player takes the counters in both of the opponent's holes and places them in the empty hole from which the player lifted the counters.

When the final counter lands in an empty hole in the inner row, the counters in the opponent's opposite hole in their inner row are captured. If there are also counters in the opponent's opposite hole in the outer row, these are also captured, but only when a capture from the inner row was also made. Players cannot sow single counters, unless there are no holes with multiple counters left, in which case single counters may be sown into an empty hole. Play continues until one player has captured all of the opponent's counters, thus winning the game.",

"input": "4x8 board. Two counters in each hole. Opening play: Two players play simultaneously, lifting and sowing counters from their outer rows. The game must begin from one of the rightmost two holes. Rules for sowing and capturing are the same as in the main phase of the game. The opening ends when both players reach an empty hole, and the first player to do so begins play in the main phase. Main phase: Play begins from any hole on the player's side of the board with counters in it. Singletons cannot move. Sowing happens in an anti-clockwise direction. If the last counter lands in an empty hole, the turn is over. For capturing: Holes are in 'opposition' when one player has the inner row hole occupied and the opponent has at least the opposite hole in the inner row occupied; if the outer row hole is also occupied it is also in opposition. However, if the opponent's inner row hole is empty and the outer row is occupied, it is not in opposition. If the last hole in a sowing falls into a hole that is is in opposition, the player takes the counters in the opponent's holes in opposition and places them in the outer row hole next to the hole from which the capture occurred. The player then sows the captured counters from this hole. If the capture is only of one counter, the contents of the appropriate outer row hole on the player's side are sown along with the one captured counter. Further captures in the sowing can occur in the same way. If a player can make a capture on the first sowing they must. Otherwise, they can choose any hole on their side to sow. However, each player has four holes from which clockwise plays can be made: the leftmost two holes in both the inner and outer rows. Clockwise moves can only be made from these holes if they immediately lead to a capture. When the captured counters are sown, they may, starting from the same hole, also be sown clockwise as long as they lead to a capture. If they cannot lead to a capture, they are sown anti-clockwise in the normal way from the outer row hole opposite the hole from which the capture was made. A player is not required to capture in a clockwise direction. If the last counter lands on a hole that is occupied but not in opposition, these counters are picked up and sowing continues. Play ends when one player captures all the opponent's counters or one player cannot play. The player who cannot play loses.",

"input": "4x8 board. Two counters in each hole. Opening play: Players simultaneously arrange their counters in the following patter, beginning from the bottom left and proceeding anti-clockwise: 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 17, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0. Players then move alternately. The first three turns are made by sowing from the holes with three holes, proceeding in order from the one furthest to the left, sowing two in the next hole and one in the following. They then sow from the next hole to the right with three counters on the next turn in the same way. Main phase: Play begins from any hole on the player's side of the board with counters in it. Singletons cannot move. Sowing happens in an anti-clockwise direction. If the last counter lands in an empty hole, the turn is over. For capturing: Holes are in 'opposition' when one player has the front row hole occupied and the opponent has both of the holes opposite it occupied. If the last hole in a sowing is in opposition, the player takes the counters in both of the opponent's holes and places them in the empty hole from which the player lifted the counters. The player then sows the captured counters from this hole. Further captures in the sowing can occur in the same way. However, each player has two hole from which clockwise plays can be made: the leftmost hole in the outer row and the second from the left in the inner row. Clockwise moves can only be made from these holes if they immediately lead to a capture. When the captured counters are sown, starting from the same hole, they can also be sown clockwise if they lead to a capture. If they cannot lead to a capture, they are sown anti-clockwise. Another alternative the player has is that, if the player plays clockwise from one of these holes and therefore makes a capture, the captured counters may be placed in the hole and left there, and the player may play instead from the other hole from which clockwise captures are allowed in a clockwise direction, if it leads to a capture. The player may continue playing from this hole as above until the possibilities to move are exhausted, and then may move from any hole in an anti-clockwise direction. Multiple captures can only be made in a clockwise direction from these holes if it is made on the first sowing of the turn. Otherwise, only one clockwise capture can be made and sowing must proceed in an anti-clockwise direction. If the last counter lands on a hole that is occupied but not in opposition, these counters are picked up and sowing continues. Play ends when one player captures all the opponent's counters or one player cannot play. The player who cannot play loses. A player may also win by capturing the counters from both of the opponent's end holes in the inner row in a single turn.",

"input": "2x7 board with two stores. Four counters in each hole. Sowing occurs in either a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction; the first player chooses the direction and all subsequent moves are made in that direction. Players sow beginning from holes in their row. In the course of sowing, a player cannot sow into a hole containing three counters; if one is encountered, it is skipped and the counter is sowed into the next hole without three. If the final counter falls into a hole containing three counters, the contents of the hole are captured and the contents of the next hole are picked up and sowing continues. Otherwise, if the last counter falls into a hole with counters, these are picked up and sowing continues, or if it falls into an empty hole the turn ends. Throughout the game, single counters cannot be moved if a player has a hole with multiple counters, and a single counter in the front hole cannot be moved if there are other single counters in the player's row. The round ends when one player's holes are empty. The player with counters remaining in their holes captures these counters.                          A second round begins with the winner of the first round placing four counters in each of their holes, leaving any surplus in the store. The loser of round one places four counters in as many consecutive holes on their side of the board as possible, and any remaining counters in the next hole. If this hole contains one, it is called puta, if two, naga, if three, wala. Holes with no counters are excluded from play for this round. If the loser has a puta hole, the opponent removes three counters from their hole opposite; if a naga, the opponent removes two from the opposite hole, if a wala, the opponent removes one. The removed counters go into their store. Puta and naga holes are marked with a piece of paper or straw in them. Empty holes are excluded from play in this round. The losing player begins the round, moving in the direction of the excluded holes, and played in the same way as the first round.  The player with empty holes begins play in the direction of the empty hole. Counters cannot be captured or sowed from puta or naga holes. Play continues as before.                          When one player has fewer than twelve counters at the beginning of a round, they may arrange them differently at the beginning. They may put one or two counters in one end hole and not more than four in the other end hole, and one or two counters in the intermediate holes, leaving some empty and, thus, excluded. The opponent then puts four counters in each of their holes. There are no puta, naga, or wala holes in this round. The player with more counters plays as before, but the one with less has captures that are determined by the number of counters placed in the first end hole. If there were two in the end hole, the player captures when dropping the final counter into a hole to make it three; or when it makes two if there was one counter in the first end hole. Otherwise, the player does not sow in holes with one or two counters.                        Play continues until one player cannot sow at the beginning of a round.",

"input": "2x6 board. Four counters in each hole. The game begins with a stylised move. One player takes one counter from their rightmost hole, and holds in in their hand. They then take one counter from the next hole, moving in an anti-clockwise direction, and place it in the next hole. They then take a counter from the next hole after that, and placing it in the next hole, continuing until there is an alternating pattern of a hole with five counters followed by a hole with three counters. The original hole from which the first counter was taken will have four counters. The player will then place the first counter taken into the next hole in the opponent's row, causing it to hold four counters. This creates a weg, a hole captured by that player, which is involved in capturing (see below). Players alternate making this first move in subsequent rounds. The next phase begins once this stylised move is completed. Sowing occurs in an anti-clockwise direction. If the final counter of a sowing falls into a hole containing counters, these are picked up and sowing continues. A player's turn ends when the final counter falls into an empty hole. When the final counter of a sowing falls into a hole containing three counters, it creates a weg, and the turn ends. Players cannot sow from a weg they've captured. A player may capture counters from an opponent's weg when the final counter of a sowing falls into the opponent's weg on the player's turn. The final counter and one counter in the weg are captured. The player may then take the counters from any of their holes and sow from there. If a player cannot play, they must pass their turn, but may play again if this becomes possible in a subsequent turn. Play ends when there are no possible moves left on the board. Players then capture the counters in their wegs. A new round begins. The players fill as many of their holes with four counters as they are able. The player with more counters will capture as many holes from the opponent in which they can place four or more counters. If the player has three remaining counters after holes are filled with four, the opponent would cede their one remaining counter to the opponent to make four and the player captures one further hole. If there are two remaining, the players draw lots to determine which player owns the remaining hole. The player who played second in the previous round begins the new round with the same stylized move, and play continues as before after that. Play continues until one player owns no holes; the opponent wins.",

"input": "2x6 board. Four counters in each hole. Players draw lots to see who goes first. There is a choice of stylised opening move. One player takes a counter from their rightmost hole, then another from the opposite hole in the opponent's row, then proceeding in this fashion in an anti-clockwise direction until the holes alternate with five and three counters, until reaching the hole from which sowing began, which will hold four. The original counter is sown into the next hole in the opponent's row, making four, thus creating a tuz, which behaves as explained below. Alternatively, the player may rearrange the counters in a similar manner, but creating an alternating pattern of holes with three and five counters, and not creating a tuz. After this, players pick up the counters in any of the holes in their row and sow them in an anti-clockwise direction. If the last counter falls into a hole that is occupied, the player picks up the contents of this hole and continues to sow. When the last counter falls into an empty hole, the play ends. Capturing occurs when the last counter falls into a hole on the opponent's side of the board containing three counters, increasing it to four. This hole, a tuz, then belongs to the player who captured it. A player cannot pick up counters from this hole, and the opponent can only do so if the last counter of their sowing falls in the tuz, in which case the opponent takes one counter from it, along with the final counter. The tuz remains in the ownership of the person who captured it. If it remains empty and the opponent drops their last counter into the tuz, the last counter is removed. Play then continues by picking up the contents of another hole and continuing to sow. If a player cannot move, they pass, but the opponent may continue to make moves. The player could then resume play if the opponent's moves create a possibility for a move. Play ends when there are no more counters available to move. Each player owns the counters in their tuz or which they have removed from the board. A second round is played, each player placing four counters into each hole starting from the rightmost hole in their row. The player with more counters gains a hole from their opponent for every four extra balls they've captured. If an opponent has three extra after counting in such a way, they also gain a hole, and if each player has two remaining counters ownership is determined by chance. Play continues in several rounds like this until one player takes all the counters.",

A second round begins with the winner of the first round placing four counters in each of their holes, leaving any surplus in the store. The loser of round one places four counters in as many consecutive holes on their side of the board as possible, and any remaining counters in the next hole. If this hole contains one, it is called puta, if two, naga, if three, wala. Holes with no counters are excluded from play for this round. If the loser has a puta hole, the opponent removes three counters from their hole opposite; if a naga, the opponent removes two from the opposite hole, if a wala, the opponent removes one.

The losing player begins the round, moving in the direction of the excluded holes, and played in the same way as the first round. The player with empty holes begins play in the direction of the empty hole. Counters cannot be sown or captured from puta or naga holes. Play continues as before, but when the final counter falls into a puta or naga hole, the contents of the opposite hole in the other row are captured.                          When one player has fewer than twelve counters at the beginning of a round, they may arrange them differently at the beginning. They may put one or two counters in one end hole and not more than four in the other end hole, and one or two counters in the intermediate holes, leaving some empty and, thus, excluded. The opponent then puts four counters in each of their holes. There are no puta, naga, or wala holes in this round. The player with more counters plays as before, but the one with less has captures that are determined by the number of counters placed in the first end hole. If there were two in the end hole, the player captures when dropping the final counter into a hole to make it three; or when it makes two if there was one counter in the first end hole. Otherwise, the player does not sow in holes with one or two counters.                      Play continues until one player cannot sow at the beginning of a round.",

A player picks up the contents of any of their holes and sowing them in an anti-clockwise direction, picking up the contents of the last hole in which his counters fall, and continuing sowing. This continues until the last counter falls in an empty hole. Then it is the other player's turn. A hole is captured when the last ball is dropped into an opponent's hole containing three counters, making it four. A player cannot then take from one of these holes that they have captured. Therefore, the player cannot begin a turn from their own captured hole nor can they continue sowing from it. If the last counter of a sowing falls into an opponent's captured hole, nothing happens on the first instance, but every time after that, one of those counters are removed from the board and placed in the store, and the sowing ends. Ownership of a hole continues even if it becomes empty. When a player cannot move (i.e., there are no counters in their holes except any that are in captured holes), the opponent continues to move until the player is able to move. Play continues until all counters are either placed in the store or in captured holes and thus cannot be moved. Players then count their pieces by placing four in each hole, and the player who has more than their original number takes ownership of one of the opponent's holes for every four counters more than the original number that have been taken. If no player took four more than the original, the player with three extra gets the hole, if each player has two extra the weaker player is given the two extra counters.

"input": "2x7 board with two stores. Four counters in each hole. Sowing occurs in either a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction; the first player chooses the direction and all subsequent moves are made in that direction. Players sow beginning from holes in their row. If the last counter falls into a hole with counters, the counters in the next hole are picked up and sowing continues, and if this hole is empty, the counters in the hole following the empty hole are captured. If there is an unbroken sequence of alternating empty and occupied holes, the counters in the occupied holes are captured until there are two empty or two occupied holes. If the final counter falls into an empty hole the turn ends. Throughout the game, singletons cannot be moved is a player has a hole with multiple counters, and a singleton in the front hole cannot be moved if there are other singletons in the player's row. The round ends when one player's holes are empty.                           A second round begins with the winner of the first round placing four counters in each of their holes, leaving any surplus in the store. The loser of round one places four counters in as many consecutive holes on their side of the board as possible, and any remaining counters in the next hole. If this hole contains one, it is called puta, if two, naga, if three, wala. Holes with no counters are excluded from play for this round. If the loser has a puta hole, the opponent removes three counters from their hole opposite; if a naga, the opponent removes two from the opposite hole, if a wala, the opponent removes one. The removed counters go into their store. Puta and naga holes are marked with a piece of paper or straw in them. Empty holes are excluded from play in this round. The losing player begins the round, moving in the direction of the excluded holes, and played in the same way as the first round. The player with empty holes begins play in the direction of the empty hole. Counters cannot be captured or sowed from puta or naga holes. Play continues as before.                          When one player has fewer than twelve counters at the beginning of a round, they may arrange them differently at the beginning. They may put one or two counters in one end hole and not more than four in the other end hole, and one or two counters in the intermediate holes, leaving some empty and, thus, excluded. The opponent then puts four counters in each of their holes. There are no puta, naga, or wala holes in this round. The player with more counters plays as before, but the one with less has captures that are determined by the number of counters placed in the first end hole. If there were two in the end hole, the player captures when dropping the final counter into a hole to make it three; or when it makes two if there was one counter in the first end hole. Otherwise, the player does not sow in holes with one or two counters.                      Play continues until one player cannot sow at the beginning of a round.",

If a player cannot play, they pass their turn, until captures are no longer possible, at which point the last person who played captures the remaining counters. A new round begins. The Raja gives each of the other players one counter. Players fill their holes with their captured counters, seven per hole. Any holes which can not be filled with seven counters are out of play. Play continues as before. A player plays as the Raja for three turns in a row, after which point it rotates to the next player. Play continues until only one player can fill holes on the board, this player becoming the winner.",

"input": "2x7 board with two stores. Four counters in each hole. Sowing occurs in either a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction; the first player chooses the direction and all subsequent moves are made in that direction. The first turn of each player must occur from one of the player's end holes. Players sow beginning from holes in their row. In the course of sowing, a player cannot sow into a hole containing three counters; if one is encountered, it is skipped and the counter is sowed into the next hole without three. If the final counter falls into a hole containing three counters, the contents of the hole are captured and the contents of the next hole are picked up and sowing continues. However, if the hole fitting these conditions is an end hole, it is treated as a puta or naga hole as described below. Otherwise, if the last counter falls into a hole with counters, these are picked up and sowing continues, or if it falls into an empty hole or one treated as a naga or puta hole, the turn ends. Throughout the game, single counters cannot be moved if a player has a hole with multiple counters, and a single counter in the front hole cannot be moved if there are other single counters in the player's row. The round ends when one player's holes are empty.                           A second round begins with the winner of the first round placing four counters in each of their holes, leaving any surplus in the store. The loser of round one places four counters in as many consecutive holes on their side of the board as possible, and any remaining counters in the next hole. If this hole contains one, it is called puta, if two, naga, if three, wala. Holes with no counters are excluded from play for this round. If the loser has a puta hole, the opponent removes three counters from their hole opposite; if a naga, the opponent removes two from the opposite hole, if a wala, the opponent removes one. The removed counters go into their store. Puta and naga holes are marked with a piece of paper or straw in them. Empty holes are excluded from play in this round. The losing player begins the round, moving in the direction of the excluded holes, and played in the same way as the first round. The player with empty holes begins play in the direction of the empty hole. Counters cannot be captured or sowed from puta or naga holes. Play continues as before.                          When one player has fewer than twelve counters at the beginning of a round, they may arrange them differently at the beginning. They may put one or two counters in one end hole and not more than four in the other end hole, and one or two counters in the intermediate holes, leaving some empty and, thus, excluded. The opponent then puts four counters in each of their holes. There are no puta, naga, or wala holes in this round. The player with more counters plays as before, but the one with less has captures that are determined by the number of counters placed in the first end hole. If there were two in the end hole, the player captures when dropping the final counter into a hole to make it three; or when it makes two if there was one counter in the first end hole. Otherwise, the player does not sow in holes with one or two counters.                        Play continues until one player cannot sow at the beginning of a round.",

They then take one counter from the next hole, moving in an anti-clockwise direction, and place it in the next hole. They then take a counter from the next hole after that, and placing it in the next hole, continuing until there is an alternating pattern of a hole with five counters followed by a hole with three counters. Upon reaching the original hole, one counter is dropping in it, and then one counter in the following hole, thus capturing the counters in this hole. Players then alternate turns, sowing in an anti-clockwise direction. When the final counter of a sowing lands in an occupied hole, these counters are picked up and the sowing continues. During sowing, the contents of any hole made to contain four counters are captured by the player in whose row the hole is located, except when this is the final counter of a sowing, in which case the player who is sowing captures these counters. When the sowing ends in an empty hole, the turn ends. Play continues until one player cannot move, and the other player captures the remaining counters. A second round is played, each player placing four counters into each hole starting from the rightmost hole in their row. The player with more counters gains a hole from their opponent for every four extra balls they've captured. If an opponent has three extra after counting in such a way, they also gain a hole, but not if there are one or two extra.

"input": "2x5 board with one store on either end. The store to the right of the player belongs to the player. Play begins with five counters in each regular hole, with one larger stone in each store, but one is slightly smaller than the other. Game can be played with two or four players. With four players, two players control the larger stones, but cannot move the regular counters. Players throw out a finger (index, little, or thumb) to determine who plays first. Index beats thumb, thumb beats little finger, little finger beats index. This happens at the start of each round. Counters are taken from any of the holes in the player's row, sowing them in either direction, including the stores. When the last counter of a sowing is dropped in a hole, sowing continues by picking up the counters in the next hole and continuing to sow in that direction. If the hole following the last seed of a sowing is empty, the counters in the hole following this empty hole are captured. If there is an empty hole following the captured hole, and then an occupied hole immediately after it, the counters in the occupied hole are also captured, and so forth until there are two occupied or two empty holes in a row. Moves may not begin from stores. Both stores are sown into normally by both players. Stores are considered to be empty, except when its large stone remains in it, then the large stone only can be sown or captured and not any other counters that may have accumulated there. Large stones can be sown in any order a player chooses during a sowing. If a player has no counters in their holes, they may opt to place one counter in each of their holes, taking counters from their store and continue play (called huelshe). If they opt not to, the opponent takes all the remaining stones on the board. If one of the large stones remains in its original store, the player cannot opt out. If the player doesn't have enough stones for all of the holes, they may choose which holes in their row to place the counters, but they must form a continuous sequence of holes with counters. When the round ends, players must buy back their large stones if they no longer have them, at a price determined in the beginning of the game (usually seven for the larger stone and six for the smaller). Players then attempt to refill their holes with the original number of counters. The player that has fewer than the original number of counters must borrow counters from the opponent. Debt accumulates over subsequent rounds. When the debt reaches five, the player must sell one of their holes to the opponent. The selling player can choose which holes to sell. The seller then receives five counters to either repay debt or fill holes as long as debt does not exceed four. ",

"input": "2x6 board. Play begins with four counters in each hole. Players begin the game simultaneously, sowing according to the rules below, until one player drops their final counter into an empty hole. A player picks up the contents of any of their holes and sowing them in an anti-clockwise direction, picking up the contents of the last hole in which his counters fall, and continuing sowing. This continues until the last counter falls in an empty hole. Then it is the other player's turn. A hole is captured when the last ball is dropped into an opponent's hole containing three counters, making it four. A player cannot then take from one of these holes that they have captured. Therefore, the player cannot begin a turn from their own captured hole nor can they continue sowing from it. If the last counter of a sowing falls into an opponent's captured hole, nothing happens on the first instance, but every time after that, one of those counters are removed from the board and placed in the store, and the sowing continues with the contents of any of the player's holes. Ownership of a hole continues even if it becomes empty. When a player cannot move (i.e., there are no counters in their holes except any that are in captured holes), the opponent continues to move until the player is able to move. Play continues until all counters are either placed in the store or in captured holes and thus cannot be moved. Players then count their pieces by placing four in each hole, and the player who has more than their original number takes ownership of one of the opponent's holes for every four counters more than the original number that have been taken. If no player took four more than the original, the player with three extra gets the hole, if each player has two extra the weaker player is given the two extra counters. Play then begins again as before. The game ends when one player owns all of the counters, and thus all of the holes.",

Players move alternately by making two moves or one capture anywhere on the board. When the flagship is moved, only one move or capture is made (thus only the flagship).                          Moves             A player may move two of the smaller playing pieces any number of vacant squares either horizontally or vertically on the board (as a rook in Chess, except that no captures can be made with this move), although if the flagship is moved, the gold player may not move another playing piece.                          Captures             A player may move any playing piece (including the flagship) one square diagonally to capture one of his opponent's playing pieces. (This move is similar to the capture-move of the pawn in Chess, except that captures can be made on any of the four diagonals.)                          This game uses displacement capture (like Chess), rather than custodial capture (like Hnefatafl), thus when a capture is made, the captured piece is removed from the board and the vacated square is occupied by the captor.                      Play continues until one player achieves his or her objective. If the flagship of the gold fleet reaches one of the outermost squares on the board, gold player wins. If the flagship is captured before it reaches the outer edge of the board, silver player wins.",

"input": "Two players play on a board ruled into a grid of 5 ranks (rows) by 5 files (columns).                          Each player has a set of 5 wedge-shaped pieces, of slightly different sizes. From largest to smallest (most to least powerful) they are: 1 king, 1 gold general, 1 silver general, 1 tokin, 1 pawn.                          There is no promotion zone in Kyoto shogi. Every time a piece makes a move it alternately promotes and reverts to its unpromoted state. Promotion is effected by turning the piece over after it moves, revealing the name of its promoted rank; demotion is effected by turning the piece back.                          The promotion rules and values are reminiscent of microshogi and entirely different from standard shogi: A king cannot promote. A tokin promotes to a lance and vice versa. A silver general promotes to a bishop and vice versa. A gold general promotes to a knight and vice versa. A pawn promotes to a rook and vice versa.                          A piece is allowed to move, capture or be dropped in a manner that will prevent it from moving on a subsequent turn, which is illegal in standard shogi. For example, a rook can move onto the farthest rank, becoming a pawn and unable to move further. Such pieces may be captured as any other.                          A captured piece may be dropped with either side facing up. There are no restrictions on where pieces can be dropped, other than that the square must be empty. So unlike in regular Shogi, pieces can be dropped in places where they can never move again, pawns can be dropped in files that already contain a pawn, and checkmate can be delivered through a pawn drop.                      The conditions to win are the same of the conditions of Shogi by checkmating the King.",

If none have been captured, the pawn must remain in place until a piece has been captured.

A King cannot castle if it has ever been checked. Players capture pieces by moving onto a space occupied by an opponent's piece. A player must say 'Gardez la reine' (Guard the Queen) when the queen is threatened. When a King can be captured on the next turn by an opponent's piece, it is in check. The King must not be in check at the end of the player's turn. If this is not possible, it is checkmate and the opponent wins. A player who causes a stalemate loses.         ",

The King cannot capture with this move. Castling, En Passant, and Pawn promotion allowed. Pawns promote to Queens when reaching the last row on the board only if that player's Queen has already been captured. An opponent's piece is captured by moving a player's own piece onto a space occupied by the opponent's piece. When a King can be captured on the next turn by an opponent's piece, it is in check. The King must not be in check at the end of the player's turn. If this is not possible, it is checkmate and the opponent wins. If the opponent is reduced to only a king, it is considered a win. Stalemate is also a win for the player causing the stalemate.                       ",

"input": "8x8 board. The pieces move as follows, with the number per player: 1 x King (king): moves one space orthogonally or diagonally. 1 x Queen (counselor): One square diagonally. 2 x Rook (rook): Any number of spaces orthogonally. 2 x Fil (elephant): Two squares diagonally, jumping over the first. Cannot capture another Fil. 2 x Knight: Moves as a chess knight. 8 x Pawn: Moves one space forward orthogonally; one space forward diagonally to capture. No en passant. Promoted to Fers when reaching the eighth rank. No castling. An opponent's piece is captured by moving a player's own piece onto a space occupied by the opponent's piece. When a Shah can be captured on the next turn by an opponent's piece, it is in check. The Shah must not be in check at the end of the player's turn. If this is not possible, it is checkmate and the opponent wins. Stalemate results in a win for that player causing it.         ",

"input": "Wellisch Chess is played on a hexagonal board with each side having length 6 and each space oriented vertically. The board has 91 spaces. The board spaces are traditionally coloured red, yellow, and either gray or black.                          Capture and Pawn Promotion:             * When pieces other than Kings and Pawns are captured, they are set aside for later Pawn promotion. When a Pawn reaches the side of the board opposite its starting side, it is eligible for promotion.             * When a Pawn is eligible for promotion, and there are pieces of that colour available from previous capture, then the Pawn is promoted to one of the captured pieces, as the player chooses.             * If there are no pieces of the given colour when a Pawn reaches the far side, then the Pawn remains where it is (unless captured) until a piece of the given colour is captured. Then, on the player's next turn, the Pawn is promoted.                          Piece Movement:             * Rooks move as in Glinski Chess.             - They slide in any of the 6 adjacent direction.             * There are no Bishops in Wellisch Chess.             * Kings can move one space in any of the six adjacent directions from their current space---West, East, or 60 degrees off either of those. They castle by swapping locations with one of the Rooks belonging to the same player. Castling can only take place when neither the King nor the Rook being moved have moved before.             * Knights move one space 'diagonally' (i.e., along an edge, to any of the six nearest spaces of the same colour). Note that a Knight always moves to a space of the same colour as the space it moved from.             * Queens can make any move that would be available to a Rook or a Knight on the current space.             * Pawns can advance with or without capturing by moving one space forward to an adjacent space slightly left or right of forward. Pawns can never advance more than one space. There is no en passant capture. As mentioned above, Pawns can be promoted upon reaching the side of the board farthest from their starting side, but can only be promoted to a piece (Queen, Rook, or Knight) of the same colour that has already been captured. If a Pawn reaches the farthest side without any captured pieces available, then it remains in that position until a piece becomes available for its delayed promotion, on the player's next turn. (Note: Currently, on a turn where the delayed promotion takes place, the possible post-promotion movement of the Pawn is displayed before the promotion visually takes place.)                          The game ends when a King is captured, or there is a stalemate due to turns elapsed without a capture or Pawn move.             * When the game ends in checkmate, the checkmating player wins, the checkmated player loses, and the remaining player draws.             * When the game ends in stalemate, all players draw. (Note: A player not being able to escape check passes the current move, This does not result in a stalemate.)                      Variations: In Wellisch's version of the game, the first player to capture another's King takes possession of the other player's pieces. (The Pawns keep their direction of movement.) In another variant, some people play with a rule that if Player 1's move exposes a threat by Player 2 against Player 3's King, then Player 2 may not capture Player 3's King until Player 3 has had a chance to move.",

"input": "Played on an 8x6 board with pieces with specialized moves. White moves first:                          Pawns (6): can move one space forwards (orthogonally or diagonally across dark squares) and can capture an enemy located diagonally across either of the adjacent dark squares (diagonal forwards and diagonal backwards). Upon reaching the last rank, Pawns promote to any major piece except a king.             -- There are no initial double moves, nor enpassant.                          Bishops (2): Can move like chess queens - any orthogonal direction or allowed diagonal direction (but not across light squares).                          Knights (2) move one space orthogonally and one space diagonally, in either order to reach a non-adjacent destination. The intermediate position may be occupied. Knights capture at their destination, but if the destination is empty, they capture an enemy along their path.                          Queen (1): can move any number of spaces diagonally only, but once per turn, may change direction while crossing a dark square. They capture an enemy at the destination.                          Kings (1): can move one space orthogonally or diagonally. The King can move twice per turn, but not in the same direction nor back to the same place. A King may capture on both parts of its turn, but only if the piece(s) captured is not defended.                           Checks:  A check is a threat to take a king, or a threat on a site that the king passes through.             -- The King may not move across- nor to- a position that remains in check at the completion of its full turn. Nor may a king be put into check by the movement of another friendly piece, including by the opening of a space that allows a knight to jump across the king, or opening a space between opposing kings.                          Note: While a king may not move across an open site under check, it may still threaten check across it, thus preventing the opposing king from occupying those sites -- because if the opposing king were captured at those sites, the game would be over and all checks would be null, including those on the intervening site.              A king does not threaten check across an occupied site.                          In no case may a King put the other king directly into check, because in all such cases both the kings would be put into check, and movement into check is forbidden.                          A King must move when in check.                          The game is won when the ememy king must move, but cannot.                       Not implemented yet and still under consideration: 13 continuous ckeck moves is also a win. the last player to move a pawn or capture a piece loses after 20 moves per player: Note that bare kings will normally end in a stalemate win before this limit is reached.",

On their first move they can move two spaces forward. They capture one space diagonally forward. There is no en passant rule.             - <i>Rooks</i> can move and capture any number of spaces orthogonally.             - <i>Bishops</i> can move and capture any number of spaces diagonally.             - <i>Knights</i> can move one space orthogonally with one space forward diagonally leaping over intervening pieces and capturing what they land on.             - The <i>Queen</i> can move and capture any number of spaces orthogonally or diagonally.             - <i>Kings</i> can move and capture one space orthogonally or diagonally.             - <i>Lieutenants</i> (shown as crosses) can move and capture diagonally upto two spaces, jumping over any piece if necessary. They can also move (but not capture) one space sideways.             - The <i>General</i> (shown as an upside-down rook) can move and capture any number of spaces orthogonally or one space diagonally.             - The <i>Warlord</i> (shown as an upside-down bishop) can move and capture any number of spaces diagonally or like a knight.             - <i>Captains</i> (shown as squares) can move and capture upto spaces orthogonally and may jump if necessary.             - <i>Hoplites</i> (shown as an upside-down pawns) can move (but not capture) one space diagonally forward. On their first move they can move two spaces diagonally forward, jumping if necessary. They capture one space forward.             <b>Winning</b>             The Spartan and Persian have different victory conditions.             <i>Spartan Victory</i>: The Spartan wins when the Persian King is checkmated as in orthodox chess.             <i>Persians Victory</i>: The Persian wins once one of the Spartan Kings is captured and the remaining Spartan King is checkmated or when both Spartan Kings are placed under simultaneous attack (duple-check) and neither King can be removed from attack on the next move (Duple-Check and Mate).             <b>First Move</b>             The Persians, being the aggressors historically and White, always move first.             <b>Check Immunity</b>             When the Spartan has two Kings in play a Spartan King is immune from check. Thus, the Spartan may move a King onto an enemy attacked square, leave a King under attack or move a piece that would expose a King to attack.             <b>Duple-Check & Mate</b>             If both Spartan Kings are placed under simultaneous attack this is a form of check called duple-check. It is illegal for the Spartan to make a move that will place both of his Kings underattack. With both Kings under attack, the Spartan loses if on his move he is unable to remove at least one King from attack. In such case the game ends in checkmate.             <b>Promotion</b>             A hoplite, upon reaching its 8th rank, may promote to any Spartan piece including a King but only if the Spartan has only one king in play.             A pawn, upon reaching its 8th rank, may promote to any Persian piece apart from the King.             <b>Capturing en passant</b>             There is no capturing en passant in Spartan Chess.             <b>Castling</b>         Spartan Kings may not castle. Persian Kings may castle as normal.",

There are two walls next to each fortress, one on the outer side of the bottom two squares of the left hand side of each fortress and one on the top edge of the two top left squares. Pieces cannot move across the wall or diagonally across the end of the wall. Four players, white and red play as a team, and black and blue as a team. Players are are arranged as follows, clockwise from the top: red, blue, white, black. Each team has the usual complement of Chess pieces, with an extra Knight, Rook, and Bishop, The pieces are as in chess, with the Kings on the players' right, on the central eight squares of each side of the board. The three extra pieces begin in the 4x4 extension at the player's right, placed anywhere they please. Kings move one square orthogonally or diagonally; Queens move any distance orthogonally or diagonally; Bishops move any distance diagonally; Knights move orthogonally one square and then diagonally another square or diagonally one square and then orthogonally one square (this is important for calculating moves near walls), jumping over any intervening pieces; Rooks move orthogonally any distance; Pawns move forward one space orthogonally, or diagonally one space forward to capture. Pawns may move two spaces on their first turn. When a pawn reaches the back row of one of the other players' sides, it is promoted to any piece. When a player moves a piece onto a space occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is captured. When a King can be captured on the next turn, it is in check. The King must not be in check at the end of the player's next turn. If this is impossible, it is checkmate and that player's pieces are removed from the game. The team who checkmates both of their opponents wins.",

Piece Movement:             * Kings can move one space in any of the 12 directions from the current space. There is no castling.             * Rooks can slide in any of the six 'adjacent' directions from their current space---North, South, or 60 degrees off either of those.             * Bishops can slide in the six 'diagonal' directions: West, East, or 30 degrees off due North or 30 degrees off due South. Note that, given the 3-colour colouring of the board, each of the three Bishops remains on the same colour that it started the game on.             * Queens can make any move that would be available to a Rook or a Bishop on the current space.             * Knights can leap to any space that is two spaces away in an adjacent direction (North, South, or 60 degrees off either of those), plus one more space 60 degrees off of that direction. Note that a Knight always moves to a space of a different colour than the space it moved from.             * Pawns can advance one space forward without capturing. They capture by moving to one of the two adjacent spaces 60 degrees left or right of forward. A Pawn on a Pawn start space can advance two spaces forward without capturing, even if it has previously moved (by capturing) to a different Pawn start space than it started the game on. A Pawn can capture an opponent Pawn 'en passant' if the opponent Pawn just advanced two spaces on its previous turn, and the capture direction of the current player's Pawn lands it on the space that the opponent Pawn just skipped over. On reaching the farthest rank in a given file, Pawns are promoted to a Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight, as the player chooses.                          The game ends on a checkmate or stalemate. By convention, the player that causes the stalemate is awarded 3/4 of a point, while the other player is awarded 1/4 of a point.                      Variations: Shift the innermost 3 or 5 Pawns toward the edge of the board by one space, as proposed in A Player's Guide to Table Games, by John Jackson, Stackpole Books, 1975.",

Only the Rooks' and Queens' pawns may move forward two spaces for their first move. Each player must move the Rooks' Pawns and Queens' Pawn in this way in their first three moves. A piece is captured when an opponent's piece moves onto its space. The King is in check when it can be taken on the opponent's next turn; it must not remain in check at the end of the player's turn. When the king cannot move out of check, it is checkmated and the opponent wins.",

"input": "De Vasa Chess is most commonly played on a 9x9 rhombus-shaped board with 81 spaces.

Piece Movement:             * All pieces other than Kings and Pawns move as in Glinski Chess.             - Queens slide in any of the 12 directions.             - Rooks slide in any of the 6 adjacent directions.             - Bishops slide in any of the 6 'diagonal' directions.             - Knights move two spaces in any adjacent direction, then one space in another direction.             * Kings step one space in any of the 12 directions, and can castle either kingside (moving two spaces) or queenside (moving three spaces). Castling can only take place when neither the King nor the Rook being moved have moved before.             * Pawns advance without capturing to an adjacent space slightly left or right of forward. On their first move, they can move two spaces in either of these directions without capturing. They capture 'diagonally forward' (i.e., to a space ahead connected by an edge, and having the same colour). En passant capture and Pawn promotion take place as in Glinski Chess.

Piece Movement:             * Queens, Rooks, Bishops, and Knights move as in Glinski Chess.             - Queens slide in any of the 12 directions.             - Rooks slide in any of the 6 adjacent directions.             - Bishops slide in any of the 6 'diagonal' directions.             - Knights move two spaces in any adjacent direction, then one space in another direction.             * Kings step in any of the 12 direction, and castle either kingside (moving two spaces) or queenside (moving three spaces). Castling can only take place when neither the King nor the Rook being moved have moved before.             * Pawns, when moving from a Pawn start space, can advance without capturing to either of the two spaces slightly left of forward, or either of the two spaces slightly right of forward, unless they are 'blocked'. A Pawn on a Pawn start space is 'blocked' if an enemy piece is adjacent to it in either of the forward adjacent directions. Pawns not on a Pawn start space can only advance one space without capturing. Pawns capture in a forward diagonal direction (i.e., to a space one row forward and off to the side, to a space connected by an edge, and having the same colour). A Pawn on a Pawn start space can also capture forwards (i.e., to the space directly ahead, having the same colour). En passant capture and Pawn promotion take place as in Glinski Chess.                      The game ends on a checkmate or stalemate.",

"input": "8x8 board. The pieces move as follows, with the number per player: 1 x King (king): moves one space orthogonally or diagonally. The King may leap to the second square on its first move if it has not yet been checked and does not hop over an opponent's piece. 1 x Queen: One square diagonally. On its first move, the Queen may jump diagonally two squares. The Queen cannot capture when making this move. 2 x Rook: Any number of spaces orthogonally. 2 x Fil (elephant): Two squares diagonally, jumping over the first. Cannot capture another Fil. 2 x Knight: Moves as a chess knight. 8 x Pawn: Moves one space forward orthogonally; one space forward diagonally to capture. May move two spaces on its first move. En passant is allowed. Promoted to Queen when reaching the eighth rank, and may make the Queen's leap on its first move after being promoted. No castling. An opponent's piece is captured by moving a player's own piece onto a space occupied by the opponent's piece. When a King can be captured on the next turn by an opponent's piece, it is in check. The King must not be in check at the end of the player's turn. If this is not possible, it is checkmate and the opponent wins. Stalemate results in a draw. Capturing all of an opponent's pieces except the King also results in a win.",

"input": "Starchess is played on a star-shaped hexagonal board that can be thought of as a hexagon-shaped board with each side having length 6, but with four spaces removed from each corner. The board has 37 spaces.                          Starchess starts off with the non-Pawn pieces being placed behind the Pawns. This happens one piece at a time, in alternating turns, until all non-Pawn pieces have been placed. Then the 'movement phase' of the game begins as usual.                          Piece Movement:             * Knights move as in Glinsky Chess.             - They move two spaces in any adjacent direction, then one space in another direction.             * Kings can move one space in any of those same six adjacent directions. There is no castling.             * Queens can slide in any of the six adjacent directions from their current space---North, South, or 60 degrees off either of those.             * Rooks can slide forward or backward only in their given column.             * Bishops can slide in only four of the adjacent directions: they cannot slide North or South.             * Pawns can advance one space forward without capturing. A Pawn on a Pawn start space can advance two spaces forward, even if it has previously moved (by capturing) to a different Pawn start space than it started the game on. Pawns capture by moving to one of the two adjacent spaces 60 degrees left or right of forward. On reaching the farthest rank in any of the innermost five columns, Pawns are promoted to a Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight, as the player chooses.                          The game ends on a checkmate or stalemate.                      Some terminology: a Pawn off to the side, in one of the two spaces at the extremes of the middle row is called a 'mummy', while a Pawn in one of the spaces adjacent to that is called a 'dead Pawn'. Mummies and dead Pawns cannot be promoted until they return to one of the innermost five columns.",

When they reach the opposite edge of the board, they are promoted to the piece which began in that space. If this is the King's space, it is promoted to Aanca. The opening position is for white: Rook, Lion, Rhinoceros, Giraffe, Crocodile, Aanca, King, Crocodile, Giraffe, Rhinoceros, Lion, Rook. This is mirrored for black so that the kings face each other. The pawns begin on the fourth row. Pieces are captured when a piece lands on a space occupied by the opposing player. The goal is to checkmnate the King. When the King can be captured on the opponent's next turn, it is in check. The player must remove the King from check on their next turn. If the King cannot move out of check, it is checkmated and the opponent wins. ",

"input": "Shafran Chess is played on a 'narrow' hexagonal board that can be thought of as a hexagonal board of size 6 with some outer spaces removed. The board has 70 spaces.                          Piece Movement:             * Queens, Rooks, Bishops, and Knights move as in Glinski Chess.             - Queens slide in any of the 12 directions.             - Rooks slide in any of the 6 adjacent directions.             - Bishops slide in any of the 6 'diagonal' directions.             - Knights move two spaces in an adjacent direction, then one space in another direction.             * Kings move as in Glinski Chess, but can also castle. In 'Long Castling', the King moves three spaces toward its queenside Rook and the Rook moves two spaces in the opposite direction. In 'Short Castling', the King moves two spaces toward its bishopside Rook (i.e., the one on the side of the board with two bishops), and the Rook moves three spaces. Castling can only take place when neither the King nor the Rook being moved have moved before.         * Pawns can advance one space forward without capturing. A Pawn on a Pawn start space can advance any number of spaces, up to the middle row of the board. Thus the outermost Pawns on their first moves can only advance one space, while the Pawns in the three innermost columns can advance up to three spaces. Pawns capture 'diagonally forward' (i.e., to a space ahead connected by an edge, and having the same colour). En passant capture works as in Glinski chess, except that if the opponent just advanced a Pawn three spaces, then the next player can perform en passant capture by landing a Pawn on either of the two spaces that the opponent Pawn just skipped over. On reaching the farthest rank in a given file, Pawns are promoted to a Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight, as the player chooses.",

Pawns can never advance more than one space. Pawns capture 'diagonally forward' (i.e., to a space ahead connected by an edge, and having the same colour). There is no en passant capture. On reaching the farthest rank in a given file, Pawns are promoted to a Rook, Bishop, or Knight. Note that a Pawn cannot be promoted to a Queen, since there are no Queens in Mini Hexchess.                      The game ends on a checkmate or stalemate.",

"input": "This game is a variant of classic Chess, which adds a random factor to the strategy. The following list describes all differences of the rules:             There is no check or checkmate, it is allowed to move the king to a square attacked by opponent's piece. The goal is to capture opponent's king.                          A die is rolled for every move. The number determines which piece can be used to make the move. 1 - pawn, 2 - knight, 3 - bishop, 4 - rook, 5 - queen, 6 - king.         If a pawn is to be promoted (would advance to the last row), the player can move it even if the die does not show 1. However, he can only promote it to the piece chosen by the die roll - for example, if 3 is rolled, the pawn can be promoted to a bishop only. If 1 is rolled, the pawn can be promoted to any piece.",

A Bidah may move two squares on its first move. Bidahs may capture en passant only when it is blocked from moving forward by another of the opponent's Bidahs; the blocked Bidah has the option in this scenario of capturing with an en passant move, with the option of capturing either of the two Bidahs in question.

If it captures on the square next to the Tor's square, from the square in front of the Tor's square, it must move backward diagonally to the square in front of the Tor's square on a subsequent turn and continue before promotion. A Bidah reaching the Kudah's square must move backward diagonally once, to the right or left, before being promoted; a Bidah reaching the Gajah's square must move backward diagonally right or left two spaces, and a Bidah reaching the Raja or Mantri's square must move backward diagonally three squares before being promoted. Bidah's can be promoted to whatever piece the player wishes.                           If the Rajah can be captured on the opponent's next turn, it is in check.

It cannot take a piece with this move. The pieces are arranged as in Chess, except the Vizier is place to the left of the Raja on both sides. Players capture pieces by moving onto a space occupied by an opponent's piece. When a Pawn reaches the opposite edge of the board from where it started, it may be promoted to the more powerful piece that begins the game in that position, but only if one of these belonging to the player has already been captured. If this has not happened, the pawn cannot move to the final row. When promoted to a Horse, the piece may immediately make a Horse's move. When a player can capture the opponent's Raja on the next turn, the Raja is in Check, the opponent's next move must free the Raja from Check. If the opponent cannot, it is Checkmate and the player wins. If a player captures all of the opponent's pieces aside from the Raja, it is a draw, or Boorj. When both players are left with only a Raja, it is a draw. Players are not allowed to stalemate the opponent. Perpetual check is not allowed, a player must make another move if such a state is entered.",

The player with the full complement of pieces rolls a six-sided die to determine which piece to move: 6=Raja, 5= Mantri, 4=Gaja, 3 = Ashva, 2=Ratha, 1= Bhata. The player with the single Raja can move it according to the moves of any piece. Players take turns moving. When one piece lands on the space occupied by another piece, it is captured. The goal of the player with a full complement of pieces is to block the single Raja so that it cannot move. The Goal of the single Raja is to checkmate the opponent's Raja.",

Each Baidaq is assigned to one of the piece types and promotes to that piece. They are placed in the third rank, with the Baidaq al-Bayadiq on the leftmost square,  with the following promotion assignments for each regular Baidaq proceeding from left to right beginning on the second square from the left: Dabbaba, Jamal, Pil, Firzan, Shah, Wazir, Zurafa, Tali'as, Asb, Rukh.  Baidaq al-Bayadiq (x1), moves like a Baidaq, but does not promote immediately when it reaches the opposite edge. Instead, it waits there, immune to capture, until a situation arises where two of the opponent's pieces could theoretically be taken by a pawn. The Baidaq al-Bayadiq is then moved to that spot, any piece (including the player's own) being moved from that spot, and then the capture being made on the next turn. It then proceeds as before, and if it is to be promoted again, it becomes a Shah's Baidaq, and is replaced on the appropriate starting position. If it is promoted a third time, it becomes Shah Masnu'a, and the original Shah's Baidaq becomes Shahzada, and both move like the Shah.  If the Shah can be taken on the next turn, it is in Check and must not be in Check at the beginning of the next turn. If a Shah is not in Check but no legal moves are available, it is a Stalemate and the opponent wins. If the Shah is in Check and it is impossible to escape, Checkmate occurs and the opponent wins. Once per game, a player  may swap a Shah which is in Check or Stalemate with another of the player's pieces. If the player can place the Shah in the extra space on the opponent's side of the board, the game is a draw. The Shah cannot enter the extra space if the opponent's Shah Masnu's occupies it. ",

"input": "8x8 board, marked as in Chaturanga. Pieces move according to specialized moves, as follows: Pawns (x8): can move one space forward and capture one space forward diagonally; Elephant (or Chariot or Boat) (x2): can move any number of spaces orthogonally; Elephant (or Camel) (x2): can move any number of spaces diagonally; Horse (2): moves in any direction, one space orthogonally with one space forward diagonally; Vizier (x1): can move any number of spaces orthogonally or diagonally; Raja (x1): can move one space orthogonally or diagonally, but can also move like the horse on its first move, if it has not yet been checked. The pieces are arranged as in Chess, except the Vizier is place to the left of the Raja on both sides. Players capture pieces by moving onto a space occupied by an opponent's piece. When a pawn reaches the opposite edge of the board from where it started, it may be promoted to the more powerful piece that begins the game in that position, but only if one of these belonging to the player has already been captured. If this has not happened, the pawn cannot move to the final row. When a player can capture the opponent's Raja on the next turn, the Raja is in Check, the opponent's next move must free the Raja from check. If the opponent cannot, it is checkmate and the player wins. If a player captures all of the opponent's pieces aside from the Raja and pawns, it is declared a half-win, or Burd. When both players are left with only a Raja, it is a draw. Players are not allowed to stalemate the opponent. If check is given 70 times in succession, the game is a draw.",

The pieces are as follows, and placed on the outer rank in the following order, starting from the left corner and moving in, with the placement mirrored on the right side (the Mautri is placed to the right of the Rajah): Tor (2): can move any number of spaces orthogonally; Kudah (2): moves in any direction, one space orthogonally with one space forward diagonally, jumping over any intervening pieces; Gajah (2): can move any number of spaces diagonally;  Rajah (1): can move one space orthogonally or diagonally; Mautri (1): can move any number of spaces orthogonally or diagonally; Bidah (8), placed in front of the other pieces: can move one space forward, or one space diagonally to capture. The Bidah are placed on the second file.  When first checked, the Rajah may move like a Kudah, or move two spaces in any direction. Players capture pieces by moving onto a space occupied by an opponent's piece. Castling may occur in two separate moves: the Tor moves next to the Rajah, and if the Rajah is checked, it may move to the other side of the Tor. Promotion of Bidahs occur when they reach the opposite edge of the board, but only immediately if they reach the Tor's square. Pawns reaching any other square must make two further moves before they can be promoted; the first must be a lateral orthogonal move, the second may be lateral orthogonal or diagonal. If the Rajah can be captured on the opponent's next turn, it is in check. The Rajah must not be in check at the end of the player's turn. If this is impossible, it is checkmate and the opponent wins.",

CAPTURING QUEEN MOVES - A monkey queen captures exactly like a Chess queen.  Slide the entire stack in any direction (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) along a straight sequence of unoccupied squares terminated by an enemy occupied square, and capture the enemy queen or baby by replacement.

NOTE: A queen of height two may not make a non-capturing move.                          NON-CAPTURING QUEEN MOVES - When not capturing, a queen moves any distance in any one direction, exactly like a Chess queen, except it leaves its bottom checker behind on the originating square, reducing the stack height by one.  The queen monkey has thus given birth to a baby monkey.                          CAPTURING BABY MOVES - A monkey baby, like a monkey queen, captures exactly like a Chess queen.  Slide the baby (singleton) in any direction along a straight sequence of unoccupied squares terminated by an enemy occupied square, and capture the enemy queen or baby by replacement.                          NON-CAPTURING BABY MOVES - When not capturing, a baby must move toward the enemy queen in the following sense:  The straight line distance between your baby and the enemy queen must be shortened by your move.

Pieces may attempt to capture an opposing piece; when doing so the ranks are revealed and the lower ranking piece is captured; if they are of equal rank they are both removed. There are bomb pieces which cannot move. Bombs eliminate other pieces attacking it and can only be removed by a miner. The spy can only attack the Marshall or the Flag. The scouts can not take each other, and winning is only possible in capturing the opponent flag",

"input": "Oust is a game for two players, played on a hexagonally patterned board which is initially empty. The two players, Black and White, take turns placing stones of their color onto unoccupied cells on the board. A group is a set of interconnected, like-colored stones. A group can be a singleton, a single stone which is not connected to any other stones of its color. A group includes all the stones of its own color connected to it. There are two types of moves - non-capturing placements and capturing placements. Non-capturing placements either forms no connections (adjacencies) with any stones, or forms one or more connections with only enemy stones. A non-capturing placement does not form any connection with stones of its own color. Making a non-capturing placement concludes your turn. When you place a stone which forms one or more connections with your own groups, you will create a new, larger group of your own stones. You can only make such a placement if said new group will have one or more connections with enemy groups upon its creation and if all said enemy groups are smaller than said new group. Upon making such a placement, all said enemy groups are removed from the board. After capturing one or more enemy groups and while it is still your turn, you must continue to add stones until you make a non-capturing placement, at which time your turn is concluded. If you have a placement available on your turn you must make one. If you don't have any placements available, you must pass your turn. There will always be a placement available for at least one player. You win by making a placement which captures all of the enemy stones on the board.",

The value of a throw is equal to the number of polished sides which land face up. A throw of sig (five polished or five rough sides up) must be made to move a piece that has not yet been moved; a throw of sig moves it 1 and grants the player another throw. If six polished sides up are thrown, the player gets another throw. If this throw is a sig, the player's throw = 7 and the player may either free the first piece and move it seven spaces or free all six pieces, moving them each one, and moving the first piece the remaining one space. Also, if the player throws six rough sides on their first turn, they get three extra throws. If any of these three throws is a sig, the value of the throw = 13, and the player may free the first piece and move it thirteen spaces, or free all of the player's pieces, moving them each one space, and then moving the first piece the remainder of the spaces. Pieces move from left to right in the player's home row, right to left in the central row, left to right in the opponent's home row, right to left in the central row, and then left to right in the player's home row.

A stick is laid in each trench, and a stick is stuck into the ground in each end hole, one belonging to each player. They move their sticks toward the opposite end of the track and then go back to their starting point, according to  the throw of four stick dice, with one flat and one convex side. The values of the throws are as follows: 4 convex sides up = 4, 3=0, 2=1, 1=0, 0=2. Players continue to throw and move until obtaining a result of 0. When the player passes the central hole, they remove the sticks from the trenches in which they land. If the player lands in the central hole, and throws a 0 on their next throw, they must then return to the space nearest to their home still containing a stick. If the player lands on the same place as the opponent, the opponent is sent back to the space nearest their home which still has a stick in it, thus eliminating this stick. The goal is to eliminate all of the sticks from the opponent's side of the board and then to land on the same space as the opponent's playing stick. If both players are in the end stage and trying to land on each other, and a player lands in the central space and then throws a 0, the game is a draw.",

"input": "Board of intersecting lines: four horizontal and up to 100 vertical. Twenty is typical. Played on two teams with even-numbered players. One piece per vertical line, lined up on the outer rows. Four sticks, white on one side and black on the other, used as dice. The value of the throw is the number of white sides that land face up, when only black are face up, the value is 6. Each player must progress through the following three stages of throws to begin playing. In the first stage, they throw four sticks. A throw of 2 or 3 ends the turn, a throw of 4 or 6 gives another throw. A throw of 1 allows the player to progress to the next stage and to add 1 to their score. In the second stage, the player throws three sticks. If the player throws two or three black, they add 1 to their score and keep throwing, three white up allows the player to add 4 to their score and keep playing; one black face up allows the player to pass to the third stage. In the third stage, the player throws two sticks. If two black are thrown, all of the previously tabulated score is lost, the turn ends and the player must start again from the first stage in their next turn. If the player throws two white, the player scores 4 and reverts back to the second phase. When the player scores one white and one black, the player enters the game and plays the pieces according to their accumulated score. Each piece must be unlocked with a throw of 1 before being  moved normally. From this point, players throw all four sticks. Throws of 2 or 3 end the turn, players continue to throw until they receive one of these values. Each throw must be assigned to move a piece and a single throw cannot be subdivided, though separate throws can be assigned to different pieces. Players may choose not to play a throw if they wish. Throws of 1 must be used to unlock a piece if there are any which are locked. Pieces move from left to right in their home row, right to left in the second row, left to right in the third row, right to left in their opponent's home row, returning to the third row and progressing from left to right, then to the second row progressing from right to left, and then back into the home row, proceeding from left to right, and so in a loop. Pieces may not pass the pieces of the opposing team. When a piece lands on the same space occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is removed from the board. The team that captures all the pieces of the opposing team wins.",

Players start from opposite ends of the board. In this game, the divisions of the arms of the board are ignored; each arm is considered one space, and the spaces between the arms are also considered a space, making eight total spaces. Players sit opposite each other, and the point in front of them is the starting point for that player. Play proceeds in an anti-clockwise direction. When one player's piece lands on a space occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is captured. A player wins by capturing all of the opponent's pieces.",

Above the end square of the central row, a triangular space, adjacent to an oval divided into three. Two teams with two players on each team. Players each start from a different point: one from the right square in the bottom left row, one from one of the triangle spaces on the left, one from the end of the curving track on the right, and the other from one of the spaces in the oval. Three pieces per player. Five sticks, with a flat side and a curved sides, used as dice. The value of a throw is equal to the number of flat sides that land face up; five curved sides up = 5. Players move their pieces from their entry points onto the central track of the board and progressing to the opposite end of the board from where they started. Pieces must move backward when they reach the end of the central track. When a player's piece lands on a space occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is taken. A piece resting on a space marked with an X is safe from capture. The team to successfully capture all of their opponent's pieces wins.",

"input": "The board consists of four rows of any number of holes. Two to twelve players, who play on two equal teams. The number of pieces per team is equal to the number of holes in one row. One team plays as pieces of camel dung, the other as sticks. The pieces begin, one in each hole, in the outer rows of the board. Eight sticks, used as dice, with a marked side and a blank side. The values of the throws are equal to the number of marked sides which land face up. A throw of 4 grants the player another throw. Pieces can only be moved for the first time with a throw of 1 or 8. One piece may move one space on a throw of 1, or eight pieces may each move one space on a throw of 8. Once a piece has made its initial move, it may move according to the throws of the sticks. The bottom team's pieces move from right to left in the home row, left to right in the next row, right to left in the third row, and then into the opponent's home row. The top team moves left to right (from their perspective) in their home row, right to left in the next row, left to right in the next row, and into the bottom player's home row. When a team's piece lands on a space in the central two rows occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is captured. Pieces cannot be captured in the home rows. When a piece moves into the opponent's home row, they move back into the central two rows, moving in the opposite direction as before. After moving into the home row a piece can no longer be captured, even when it is in the central two rows. Play continues until both team's pieces have moved out of their home row and can no longer be captured. Players then alternate turns throwing the sticks, removing one of the opponent's pieces every time a 4 is thrown. A team wins when only their pieces are left on the board.",

The opponent may only capture, according to the following rules, but only one piece at a time is captured, even when multiple would normally be allowed. When the one player is reduced to five pieces, play continues as follows. Players must capture pieces when possible. Capturing is accomplished by moving to an adjacent intersection to an opposing piece in the continuing direction of the capturing stones movement, or by moving away from an adjacent opposing pieces in such a direction. When an opponent's piece is captured, all other of the opponent's pieces in that line are also captured. Multiple captures can be made, but cannot be done by moving twice in the same direction.

Stepping:             Stepping is moving one of your checkers to an orthogonally or diagonally adjacent empty square, and this kind of move is subject to the following two additional restrictions:             • A step my never bring the number of orthogonal enemy neighbors of the moved checker down to 0.             • The only condition under which a step may fail to bring the moved checker closer to the center of the line you are moving along is if it brings its number of orthogonal enemy neighbors up from 0.                          (Some elaboration on this last restriction: In general, a step must decrease the moved checker's straight line distance to the board's central intersection. That's the same as bringing it closer to the center of the orthogonal or diagonal line you are moving along. (Note: The center of a diagonal line is an intersection if it is an even number of squares long, and a square otherwise. The center of an orthogonal line is an edge if it is an even number of squares long, and a square otherwise.) Here is a different way of putting it: Whatever diagonal or orthogonal line you are stepping along, the largest distance to an edge square on this line before the step must be bigger than the largest distance to an edge square on the same line after the step. The only exception to this rule, as explained in the last restriction, is if your checker has no orthogonal neighbors and can step into such a relationship – then you may step in any direction.)                          Jumping sequences:             If a checker of your color is orthogonally adjacent to an enemy checker, and immediately on the opposite side of that enemy checker is either an empty square or the outside of the board, your checker may initiate a sequence of jumps. You do this by jumping your checker over to the opposite side of the enemy checker and immediately removing the jumped piece. If your checker lands outside the board, it too is removed from the board. Note: If your last checker is removed when you capture your opponent's last checker, you still win.                      If the jumping checker lands in a position where it can jump again, your turn does not end, and the checker must make yet a jump. If there are several ways to continue the sequence, you may choose freely between these. The sequence of jumps only ends when the checker lands on a square where it can make no further jump.",

"input": "Overview:             In Seesaw the players (North and South) command opposing armies with soldiers that can promote. Your army starts out as a single soldier and your promotion area evolves as you deploy more soldiers. Every time a soldier promotes it grows - first into a 2-stack, then a 3-stack, and so on.                           The central idea of Seesaw is the 2-fold significance of stack-size:              (i) Odd-sized stacks move forwards and even-sized stacks move backwards, and              (ii) on any given turn, a stack can take as many steps as it likes from 1 up to its size.                           This results in soldiers seesawing up and down the board as their strength increases to the point where the game is forced to conclude in one side completely eliminating the other.                          How to play:             On your turn, you must either make a stack-move, or place a new stack.                           1. Placing a new stack:              A newly placed stack will always be of size 1. You may only place a stack on an empty cell next to a cell of your color. These cells are promotion cells, and each cell you place a new stack on automatically turns into a promotion cell of your color.                          2. Stackmoves:             You only ever move one stack per turn, but that stack may be able to move several steps or capture several enemiy stacks, depending on its size.             The number of steps a stack may take is the number of pieces in it, i.e. its size.                          2.1 Noncapturing moves: On turns where you do not have to capture an enemy (see below) all the steps a stack takes is either constrained to the 3 upward directions or to the 3 downward directions, depending on the size and the owner of the stack. South's forward directions are the 3 upward directions, and North's forward directions are the 3 downward directions.                          2.2 Capturing moves: If one or more of your stacks can reach an enemy by lifting the restraint on direction, you must capture such a reachable enemy by replacement. If that stack did not spend all its steps reaching the captured enemy, you can, before you end your turn, spend the left-over steps by making a noncapturing move. However, if yet an enemy is in range immediately after you have captured (counting only the steps left over), you must capture again.                          3. Promoting: Your odd-sized stacks promote when they end up on a promotion cell belonging to your opponent at the end of your turn. Your even-sized stacks promote when they end up on a promotion cell belonging to you at the end of your turn.                      The object of Seesaw is to capture all your opponent's soldiers. More precisely: If, at the end of your turn, your opponent has no stacks on the board, you have won the game.",

"input": "10x10 board. Twenty pieces per player, arrayed on the dark-colored spaces. The square in the left-hand corner closest to the player is a dark square. Pieces move one space forward diagonally. When a piece arrives at the furthest rank opposite their starting position, it becomes a king. Kings may move diagonally, forward or backward, any number of spaces (like a bishop in Chess). Captures are made by hopping over an adjacent piece in a diagonal or orthogonal direction, including backwards. Multiple captures are allowed, in which the player may change direction. Kings capture by flying leap. Captures are mandatory, and the maximum capture should be made based on the value of pieces. Kings are worth less than twice the number of regular pieces, but more than twice the number of pieces minus one. (e.g., three kings are worth less than six pieces, but more than five pieces). If more than one maximum capture has the same value, the one that captures more kings takes precedence. It is permitted to use the same space more than once, but not to hop over the same piece twice. Captured pieces are removed after the turn is complete. The maximum capture can be enforced when the opponent catches it, though the opponent may opt not to point it out. A king cannot make three non-capturing moves in a row without moving another king or piece. This rule does not apply if the player only has one king remaining. If one player has only two kings remaining and the opponent has only one king remaining, the player with two kings must win in seven turns. If they do not, the game is a draw. If both players have only one king remaining and neither of them is able to capture or will be forced into a position where their king will be captured on the next turn, the game is a draw. The player who captures all of their opponent's pieces wins, or if they cannot make a legal move.",

"input": "In Seesaw Draughts, when a man reaches the rank farthest away in its stepping direction, its capture range is increased and it changes the direction it steps in. It can thereby promote again if it reaches the opposite rank.                          The mechanism is implemented like this: All men are stacks. Single pieces are stacks of size 1. Every time a man promotes a piece is added to it, so it's stack size increases by 1. The following two-fold meaning of stack size is the key idea:         1) Odd stacks step forwards and even stacks step backwards.     2) A stack of size n can capture a piece up to n steps away in a straight line provided that there are no pieces between the capturing piece and its target, and that the square immediately behind the target in the capture direction is empty. The capturing piece must land there.          Thus, the men gradually acquire the capturing power of a king in Thai Checkers as they seesaw up and down the board.          There is no obligation to choose the capture sequence that maximizes the number of pieces captured. We deem this calculation a bit too demanding when a stack's range is a function of its size.      Other than this, the rules are as in Brazillian Draughts/Checkers, which is like International Draughts, but on 8x8.",

A piece leaps over an adjacent enemy piece onto a vacant adjacent intersection point on the other side. The leap must be in a straight line following the pattern on the board. Even pieces that are not yet promoted to King can capture enemy pieces backwards. A player's piece must continue to capture within a turn provided each capture meets the criteria of the short leap.             A piece is promoted to King when it reaches the other player's first rank.

"input": "The game is played on a board with twelve points on either side. The points form a continuous track in a horseshoe shape; each player progresses in opposite directions (one from their bottom right to the top right, the other from their bottom left to their top left). Each player has 15 pieces. The starting position is as such, numbering the points from the origin of each player's track: Point six: five pieces. Point 8: three pieces. Point 13: five pieces. Point 24: two pieces. Players move according to the number on each die by moving one piece the number on one die and another the number on the other die, or by moving one piece twice (once for each die). Players cannot end their move on a point with multiple opposing pieces. If a player ends the turn on a point with one opposing piece, that piece is placed in the middle of the board (not on a point) and must reenter the board according to the next die roll, counting the origin point as a move of one. They cannot reenter on a point with two or more pieces. No other pieces can move until all of the pieces belonging to that player are removed from the center. When all of a player's pieces are on their final 6 points, they may start removing pieces from the board. They can do so by rolling a 6 to move from the 6th point, and so on down to 1. Players must use all available moves presented by the dice. The first player to remove all of their pieces wins. The winner gains one point, or two points if the opponent has pieces in their starting quadrant.         ",

"input": "Sixteen 3x8 rectangles are arranged in a circle, each rectangle touching the corner of another on its left and right. The second, fifth, and eighth squares (counting from the top) in the outer rows, and the third and sixth squares in the central row of each rectangle are marked. Can be played with sixteen, eight, or four players. It can be played individually, or on two teams. Each rectangle has one set of four pieces. They enter the board from the center, proceeding down the central row or their respective rectangles, proceeding in the outer rows of the rectangles in an anti-clockwise direction. When a complete circuit of the board has been made, the pieces must travel down the central row again and exit the board with an exact throw. The game is played with two eight-sided die, containing the following values: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16 on one, 2, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16 on the other. It may also be played with four rectangular dice each with the values 1, 3, 4, 6. Pieces are entered on the throw of nine. Doubles allow a second roll.Spaces moved may be broken up between two pieces but each piece must move a number equal to that displayed on one of the dice. A player can pass, but only before the die is thrown. When two pieces of the same color occupy a space, no other pieces may pass them. These pieces may then move as a single pawn. If a piece lands on the same spot occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is sent back to the start. Two pieces moving as a single pawn can only be sent to start by two other pieces moving as a single pawn. Pieces on a marked space cannot be sent to start. A  play which sends an opponent's piece to start allows another roll. A player may bypass the central row and circuit the board another time if they wish (i.e., in order to send another player back to start to prevent them from winning). The first player to remove all their pieces from the board wins, and the other platers continue playing until all but one player have moved their pieces into the center.",

Players move according to the number on each die by moving one piece the number on one die and another the number on the other die, or by moving one piece twice (once for each die). If doubles are rolled, the player must play the number on each die twice. Players cannot end their move on a point with multiple opposing pieces. If a player ends the turn on a point with one opposing piece, that piece is placed in the middle of the board (not on a point) and must reenter the board according the the next die roll, counting the origin point as a move of one. They cannot reenter on a point with two or more pieces. No other pieces can move until all of the pieces belonging to that player are removed from the center. When all of a player's pieces are on their final six points, they may start removing pieces from the board. They can do so by rolling a 6 to move from the 6th point, and so on down to 1.

Players cannot end their move on a point with multiple opposing pieces. If a player ends the turn on a point with one opposing piece, that piece is placed in the middle of the board (not on a point) and must reenter the board according the the next die roll, counting the origin point as a move of 1. They cannot reenter on a point with two or more pieces. No other pieces can move until all of the pieces belonging to that player are removed from the center. When all of a player's pieces are on their final 6 points, they may start removing pieces from the board. They can do so by rolling a 6 to move from the 6th point, and so on down to 1. Players must use all available moves presented by the dice. The first player to remove all of their pieces wins.         ",

The outer corners of each square are marked with a cross, as are the third and sixth space from the same corner. Four players, playing on two teams. Four pieces per player. The pieces are red, green, yellow, and black. Players start with one piece on the sixth and seventh space of the central row in their arm, and two pieces on the third space in the outer row of their arm, to the right. Two rectangular four-sided dice, with the following throws: 1, 3, 4, 6. Players use the throw of a die to move a piece; they may therefore may move two pieces each the value of one of the dice, or one piece twice, using the value of each dice. Play moves down the central track of the player's arm, around the outer perimeter of the board in an anti-clockwise direction, and back up the central row of the player's arm, proceeding into the large central square. When a player's piece moves into a space occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is sent to the central square, from which it must begin again. A player cannot move into their central row, approaching the end of the track, unless two of their team member's pieces have moved past the player's own pieces. If two or more of the team member's pieces remain behind the player's own pieces, the player's pieces may not advance past the final three spaces in the left hand track of their home arm of the board. Neither they, nor any of the team's pieces, can proceed until two of the team member's pieces are placed, by exact throws, on the left inner corner of the arm of the player wishing to advance. These two pieces must then proceed together; i.e., only on double throws of the dice, with the exception that a double they cannot be used if it would cause them to land on a space occupied by a team member waiting to move. Once a double throw is successfully made and both pieces moved, the waiting pieces may proceed up the central row. When players cannot move the throws, they pass their turn. Players must move into the central square with an exact throw. The first team to place all of their pieces in the central square wins.",

Pieces may only move into the twelfth point on their side of the board (Hucke) with a throw that allows two pieces to move there at once. A player cannot move into or hit pieces in the opponent's Hucke. Players may move beyond their Hucke only on a throw that allows them, to move two pieces from the Hucke onto the opposite side of the board. Each player has another piece, placed at the tip of their point. The player moves this piece to mark the score they earn. Points are awarded as follows: When it is possible for a player to land on a space occupied by a single piece belonging to the opponent (a hit), a player gains one point. Hitting the opponent's Hucke is only possible by throwing two 1s with at least four pieces on the player's own Hucke. For a given throw, all possible hits made by any legal move are counted. Players move their pieces after the possible hits are calculated. A player gains two points by bringing all of their pieces into the final section of the board and bearing all of their pieces off by throwing more than the number of remaining spaces.

Players use throws to unstack pieces on their points, unstacking one piece per die which corresponds to that point. Doubles allow the player to unstack or bear off a number of pieces equal to the total number of the throw.  When all of the pieces are unstacked, that player may begin bearing their pieces off. Players move according to the number on each die by moving one piece the value on one die then another piece the value on the other die, or by moving one piece the value of one die and then the value of the other.

"input": "5x5 board, marked with an X in the central square and the midpoints of the outer circuit of spaces. Four players. Four pieces per player. Four seeds, with one white side and one dark side, used as dice. The values of the throws are equal to the number of white sides up, except when no white sides are up the throw equals 8. Throws of 1, 4, and 8 grant the player another throw. Players make all of the throws in their turn first, and then move the values of the throws individually. A player cannot subdivide the value of a single throw between pieces, but may move more than one piece in a turn if they have multiple throws, moving a piece the value of an entire throw. Pieces may only enter the board with a throw of 1. When a player has no pieces on the board, throws made before a throw of 1 do not count and cannot be played. Pieces enter on the marked square on the outer track of the square in front of the player. Pieces move anticlockwise around the outer squares of the board until they reach the square just before the square from which they started, then moving to the inner track and moving clockwise, and then onto the central square. Multiple pieces may occupy the same square. If a player's piece lands on a spot occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is removed from the board and must be entered again. If the opponent has multiple pieces on this spot, they all are sent to the beginning. Sending an opponent's piece off the board grants the player another throw. Pieces on marked squares cannot be sent off the board. If a player has two pieces on the marked square on the opposite side of the board from the one in which they begin, the player may declare these as a twin which then play as one piece. Twins move half the value of a throw, rounding down. Twins may only be sent off the board by another twin. Twins may not send back to start a single piece belonging to an opponent. When sent off the board, the twins enter the board again as single pieces. When the twin reaches the central space, it becomes two single pieces again. When all of a player's pieces are in the central square, they may begin bearing them off. A throw of 1 is required to bear a piece off. The player who bears off all their pieces first wins.",

Players move according to the number on each die by moving one piece the number on one die and another the number on the other die, or by moving one piece twice (once for each die). If doubles are rolled, the player must play the number on each die twice. Players cannot end their move on a point with multiple opposing pieces. If a player ends the turn on a point with one opposing piece, that piece is placed in the middle of the board (not on a point) and must reenter the board according the the next die roll, counting the origin point as a move of one. They cannot reenter on a point with two or more pieces. No other pieces can move until all of the pieces belonging to that player are removed from the center. When all of a player's pieces are on their final 6 points, they may start removing pieces from the board. They can do so by rolling a 6 to move from the 6th point, and so on down to 1.

Four players, played on two teams, with team members sitting on opposite sides of the board. Four pieces per player, with the colors red, black, yellow, and green. Six cowrie shells used as dice: five are white and one is yellow. The number of the mouths which are face-up determine the value of the throw, except for a throw of 3 when one of the cowries with the mouth down is the yellow one, in which case the throw is known as So-hatara, and counts as 4, but allows special moves because it is actually considered four individual throws of 1. When the player throws 1, 5, or So-hatara, the player receives an extra throw. A 1, 5, or So-hatara must be thrown to enter a piece on the board. The entirety of a throw must be used to move one piece, but separate throws in a turn can each be used individually to move a different piece. This does not apply when So-hatara is one of the throws; in this case, the total of the throw can be subdivided however the player sees fit. Pieces enter the board from the center, moving down the central track of their arm, then in an anti-clockwise direction around the board, and then back up the central row of their arm of the board to the central square. If a player lands on a space occupied by a piece of the opposing team, the opponent's piece is sent back to start. Pieces resting on the corner spaces between the arms of the cross cannot be sent to start in any circumstance. The first team who places all of their pieces in the central square wins.         ",

"input": "Played on a board with 36 holes arranged in a square, with a gap in the center of each side. There are two semi circles of five holes on the outside of two opposite corners of the board. Two pieces per player. Four stick dice are used, each with one marked side. Each die is marked differently for a different value: 4, 6, 14, 15. The throws are as follows: All marked sides up = 5; three marked sides up = 3; two marked sides up = 2, one marked side up = the value of the marked side; zero marked sides up = 10. Throws of 14 may instead be played as a throw of 1, whenever the player chooses. Players’ pieces enter on the branching arcs. Players move in opposite directions around the board, and then back down the arc in which they started, moving their pieces off the board. If a player lands on the same spot as the opponent, the opponent’s piece is removed from the board and must re-enter. A player's piece is allowed to occupy the same space as that player's other piece. On the last side of the rectangle before completing a circuit of the board, only throws of 1, 2, or 3 are used. Players must make an exact throw to get a piece off the board. The first player to remove their pieces from the board wins.         ",

At this point, the piece returns to the player's own right grid, on the bottom left corner, and proceeding in an anti-clockwise direction into the central row, and off the board once moving past the final space. When a player lands on a space occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is removed from the board and must re-enter as before.

The pieces move along the outer track of the board according to the throw of three four-sided dice with values of 1, 2, 5 and 6. The values of each die must be played individually, except in certain cases. Each player has four pieces, which begin on the sixth and seventh space of the central row and the seventh and eight space in the right hand row of the arm of the board belonging to the player. If a piece lands on a space occupied by an opponent, the opponent's piece is sent back to the starting position. If two of a player's pieces are on the same space, they cannot be sent to the beginning. In addition, when three pieces are on the same spaces, if triple sixes are thrown the pieces may move twelve spaces together. The same rule applies for threes and twos, moving six and four, respectively. After completing a circuit of the board, the pieces then move into the central row of squares in the arm where the player began. The player must then move off all of their pieces by an exact roll. If a player has removed all of their pieces from the board and their partner is still playing, the player rolls on what would be their turn and the partner moves according to these rolls in addition to their own turn. The player or team to remove all of their pieces from the board first wins.         ",

"input": "2x12 board, with the spaces rendered as points, divided into half. Fifteen pieces per player. Two six-sided dice. Players move according to the number on each die by moving one piece the value on one die then another piece the value on the other die, or by moving one piece the value of one die and then the value of the other. A throw of doubles forces the player to play the throw twice. Each player's pieces begin in three stacks of five, on the leftmost point (with respect to the opponent) on the opponent's side of the board. Play proceeds (with respect to the player) from right to left on the opponent's side of the board, and then from left to right on the player's side of the board. A player cannot place two pieces on a single point on any of the first eleven points of the board, except for those pieces in the starting position, until one of the player's pieces has first landed on the twelfth point. However, a player may place two pieces on any point after the twelfth point, regardless of whether a piece has ever landed on the twelfth point. A player cannot move a piece onto a point containing two or more pieces belonging to the opponent. When a piece lands on a point occupied by a single piece belonging to the opponent, it is removed from the board and must be entered again, and can only do so using the value of one die, not both, with the starting point considered to be point 1, the next point 2, etc. Opponent's pieces can be removed from the board in this way when reentering the board. To win, a player must place their pieces in one of the following winning positions: five pieces on each of the final three points; three pieces on the final five points; seven on the final point, five on the penultimate point, and three on the antepenultimate point; fifteen on the final point. If none of these positions are possible, the player must bear off all of their pieces once all of their pieces have reached the final six points. The first player to reach a winning position or to bear off all of their pieces wins.",

"input": "Played on a standard Backgammon board. Each player starts with fifteen pieces on the starting point of their track. Two six-sided dice. The pieces move around the board in opposite directions in a horseshoe-shaped track.                          Each player rolls one die. The player who rolls highest goes first. The player then rolls two die to begin play.  The numbers on the two dice constitute separate moves; i.e. a piece must move the full value of an individual die. One piece may move the combined total of the two die. Doubles are played twice. A player must use both numbers of a roll if possible, or all four numbers in the case of doubles.                           If a player lands on a point occupied by a single opposing piece, the opponent’s piece is trapped until the trapping player removes their piece.                          A piece may not be moved to a point occupied by two or more of the opponent's pieces. The player cannot move a piece to a point where the opponent has trapped another of the player's pieces.                           Once a player has moved all fifteen of their pieces into the their home section of the board (that is, the six points at the end of the player's track), the player may begin bearing off. A player cannot bear off when the player has one or more pieces trapped inside the their home section. A player bears off by rolling a number equal to the number of points left in the track of a piece, plus one. If there is no piece on the point indicated by the roll, then the player must make a legal move using a piece that will not remove it from the board. If there are no pieces available to fulfill this condition, the player must remove a piece that is furthest from the goal. The first player to bear off all fifteen pieces wins the game.                          If the last piece belonging to player remains in the starting position is trapped by the opponent before it has left the starting position, the player loses. The only exception is if the opponent still has pieces on their starting position. A game in which both players' respective pieces in the starting position are trapped is a draw.                          In Tavli, in subsequent rounds, the winner of the previous round plays first.                      The game is also typically played with a point system, where points are lost based on the winning conditions. Players lose two points by losing if they haven't yet borne off any of their pieces, or one point if they have borne off at least one piece. A player who loses because their final piece in the starting position was trapped loses two points.",

"input": "The game is played on a board with twelve points on either side. The points form a continuous track in a horseshoe shape; each player progresses in opposite directions (one from their bottom right to the top right, the other from their bottom left to their top left. Each player has 15 pieces. The starting position is as such, number the points from the origin of each player's track: Point six: five pieces Point 8: three pieces Point 13: five pieces Point 24: two pieces Play begins by each player rolling one die; the player with the highest roll plays first and plays the numbers on this first roll. Players move according to the number on each die by moving one piece the value on one die then another piece the value on the other die, or by moving one piece the value of one die and then the value of the other. If doubles are rolled, the player must play the number on each die twice. Players cannot end their move on a point with multiple opposing pieces. If a player ends the turn on a point with one opposing piece, that piece is placed in the middle of the board (not on a point) and must reenter the board according the the next die roll, counting the origin point as a move of 1. They cannot reenter on a point with two or more pieces. No other pieces can move until all of the pieces belonging to that player are removed from the center. When all of a player's pieces are on their final 6 points, they may start removing pieces from the board. They can do so by rolling a 6 to move from the 6th point, and so on down to 1. Players must use all available moves presented by the dice. The first player to remove all of their pieces wins.",

The corner squares are marked with an X, the central two squares of the left, right, and top side are marked with one X across both squares. Two or four players; when there are four players they play on two teams of two. Three cowrie shells per player, used as pieces. Six cowrie shells used as dice; the throws = the number of mouths that land face up. Players move their pieces onto the board and around the circuit according to the throws of the cowries. Teams start on opposite ends of the bottom row of squares, up the vertical line to the square, in opposite directions around the square, then up the remaining part of the vertical row and down the arc, and off the board. When a piece lands on a space occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is sent back and must enter the board again. Pieces are safe from being sent back if they rest on a marked square. The first team to remove all of their pieces from the board wins. ",

"input": "The object of the game is to be the first player to occupy the opponent's castle with two of your own pieces, or, to capture all of your opponent's pieces while retaining two or more of your own pieces. Both knights and pawns can move either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally in three ways, as follows: One space in any direction (like a king in chess). This is called a plain move. A leaping move (called cantering) over an adjacent friendly piece to a vacant space immediately beyond. Multiple leaps over a player's own pieces are permitted. Cantering is always optional (never obligatory). A jumping move over an adjacent enemy piece to a vacant space immediately beyond. The enemy piece is captured and removed from the board. As in checkers, multiple jumps are allowed, and capturing is obligatory whenever it is possible. Pawns may make any of the three moves, but only one type of move per turn. Knights have a fourth option: a combination move consisting of a canter immediately followed by a jump (capture). This is called the knight's charge. The knight may, in this single move, perform multiple canters (or just one), followed by multiple jumps (or just one); but the canter(s) must precede the jump(s). A knight may not combine a plain move with a canter or a jump.",

This can be divided into two throws of 1 to move two pieces. Play moves from left to right in the player's home row, from right to left in the second row, left to right in the third row, and right to left in the opponent's home row. When a piece enters the opponent's home row, it can no longer move. When a player's piece lands on a space occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is captured. A player may not land on the same space as another of the player's pieces. The player which fills up the most of the opponent's home row wins.",

The first pawn to reach the opposite side wins.",

"input": "3x12-28 board. Players begin with soldiers, equal in number to the number of spaces in one row for each player, which begin in the spaces in the row closes to the player. Each player has one king piece, which begins in the rightmost space in the central row with respect to the player. Four six-sided dice with values from 1-6. A throw of 1 is called Chong. Pieces move in a boustrophedon path along the board, from left to right in their home row, right to left in the center row, and then left to right in their opponent's row.                           A player must first throw a Chong to play. On this turn, when a player throws one Chong, the King exchanges places with the soldier behind it. If more than one Chong is thrown, the King exchanges places with the soldier that many spaces behind it. Any remaining values in the throw are moved by the soldier which took the king's space. Once this move has taken place, pieces move according to the throws of the dice, which can be subdivided between the pieces as the player sees fit. The King only moves with a Chong, and it exchanges the place of a piece that number of occupied squares away, i.e., only spaces occupied by the player's pieces are counted when moving the King. When the player has only one soldier and the King, the King may move normally (like a soldier does), but on throws of Chong. When only the King is left, the first Chong in a throw is ignored and only the second, third, or fourth Chongs are moved.                            When a player's piece lands on a space occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is captured. An opponent's King cannot be taken by a soldier until it has first moved backwards, and then it can only be taken by a Chong.                          The game continues after the players' Kings have been taken.                      When a player reaches the end of the opponent's home line, the player wins.",

"input": "Each turn consists of moving a piece one square orthogonally in any direction. An animal may eat any animal smaller than itself by moving on to its square. The only exception to this rule is that the rat can kill the elephant. If the same animals meet, the animal moving on to a square eats the animal already there. Three pieces have special powers. When the rat reaches the river it can enter it and move along those squares squares as if it were any other. If it is in the river no other animal can attack it. The rat is unable to attack the elephant from the river. If both rats meet in the river the moving piece eats the other one. When a lion or a tiger reaches a square on the edge of the river, at the next move it can jump over the river in any orthogonal direction, landing on the nearest land square. It captures any smaller animal on that square: if, however, there is a rat in the river in the line of the jump, it blocks this move. Each side has three trap-squares and the player's own pieces may move on and off them without restriction, but if an enemy animal occupies a trap-square, it loses all its power and becomes weaker than any defending piece. As soon as it moves out of the trap it regains its full strength. A player may not move any of his animals on to his own den. The player who moves any of their pieces into the enemy's den wins.",

"input": "5x5 grid, with six spaces extending up from the rightmost column. The central space of the grid is the minaret, the final three spaces in the extending track are Cairo, Medina, and Mecca. Three pieces per player, each having one father, one mother, and one djinn, which all begin on the first space. The track is boustrophedon, starting in the bottom left corner and moving to the right, until it reaches the top right corner where it proceeds down the extended track. Six sticks, used as dice, with one polished side and one rough side. Throws equal the number of polished sides which land face-up, with the following exceptions: five polished or five rough sides = sig, this grants a move of one plus another throw, in which the player moves the number of polished sides up, six polished = sig of 6, grants the player another throw, and the player moves the number of polished sides up; if the second throw is regular sig, the value is 7, six rough = sig of twelve, grants the player three throws and the player moves the number of polished sides up; if any of those three extra throws are a regular sig, the total value of the extra throws is 13. Pieces move one at a time from the starting space. The first piece to move is the father, the second the djinn, and the third is the mother. The djinn moves twice the value of the throw in any space that does not require a sig to move through it. A player must throw a regular sig to leave the starting space; when they do, they move one space and throw again. When a player passes the piece of an opponent, the opponent's piece returns to the starting space and must enter the board according to the same rules. Certain spaces require a throw of sig to move into and out of them. This means that the move of 1 given by the regular sig can be used to do this, but the extra throw granted by it does not; however, the total value awarded by a sig of six or twelve does count. These are the Minaret, and all of the spaces in the extended track. If a player cannot enter a space because their is not a sig attached to their throw, they stop their move at the point before it. The space for Cairo counts for three of the value of the throw. When a piece reaches Mecca and there is still value left in the throw, the next piece may be entered and moved using the remaining moves left in the throw. The djinn is entered when the father reaches Mecca, and the mother is entered once the djinn reaches Mecca. The first player to place all of their pieces on Mecca wins.",

Pieces moves in a spiral track around the board in an anti-clockwise direction until they reach the space before the starting point, at which point they proceed around the inner circles in a clockwise direction, and then to the central space. When a player lands on a space occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is sent back to their starting position. When a player reaches the central square by an exact throw, it is removed from the board. The first player to remove all four of their pieces from the board wins.",

Moving into a square containing an ally ghost             is not allowed. A player can also move off one of his good             ghosts from one of the opponent's corner squares. A player             wins when one of the three conditions is satisfied:             • All the player's evil ghosts are captured.             • All the opponent's good ghosts are captured.             • One of the player's good ghosts is moved off the board         from one of the opponent's corner squares.",

They then turn left and proceed around the inner perimeter of squares in a clockwise direction, until the space directly between the origin point and the central square, from which the pieces proceed to the center. When a piece overtakes a piece owned by the opponent, and the opponent's piece is not on one of the central squares of the perimeter, the opponent's pieces are sent back to the origin point, and the player is awarded an extra throw for each piece sent back.

The dark squares make up the house of the Dark player, and the light squares make up the house of the Light player. The goal is to empty your opponent's house.                          There are two types of moves in Overflow, both of which are sowing moves, somewhat akin to what you see in mancalas. All moves are bound by the restriction that there must always be exactly one orthodiagonally connected group of stacks on the board. The one kind of sowing only drops pieces onto already occupied squares and the other kind spills out of both the group of already occupied squares and out of the board itself, hence the names: contained moves and overflow moves.                          Sowing in general:             Sowing in general is picking up a stack from any square and distributing its pieces along one of the 8 directions onto a contiguous line of squares – usually placing one of the N pieces from the chosen stack in each of the N or so squares in the sowing direction. The details are given below.                          Overflow moves:             An overflow move involves sowing into empty squares – possibly in addition to occupied squares – and over the edge of the board. It's important to remember that these two things always go together in this game, namely (1) sowing over the edge and (2) sowing into empty squares. That is to say, if you are to sow into one or more empty squares, the number of squares in the chosen sowing direction must be smaller than the number of stones in the chosen stack. The pieces that end up outside the board are removed from the game.                          Contained moves:             Contained moves only sow onto already occupied squares. A contained move must sow the chosen stack as far as possible. If it's impossible to sow each of the pieces in the stack into an occupied square of its own, you place the remainder of the pieces on the last occupied square you reached. You are not obligated to chose the stack that can be sown the farthest, but whatever stack you chose, if you do not make an overflow move move with it, you must chose a sowing direction that allows you to sow onto as many occupied squares as possible.                          You may always chose freely between contained moves and overflow moves when both kinds are available.                      Note that no stack will have both a contained move and an overflow move available in the same direction. All moves are completely determined by the choice of stack and direction.",

"input": "The 32 pieces are shuffled and randomly allocated face-down to squares on the board.                           The first player turns up a piece to begin the game. The color of that first uncovered piece is the color he or she will play in the game. The second player then makes a move, and the two alternate until the game is finished.                          There are three kinds of moves. A player may turn a piece face-up, move a piece, or capture an enemy piece. In some game variants, multiple captures may be made in one turn.                          Turning a piece face-up is a legal move if there are any face-down pieces on the board. Once revealed, a piece may move, capture, or be captured.                           A player may only move face-up pieces of their own color.                          Unlike Xiangqi, all pieces move identically: a piece may move only one square up, down, left, or right. A piece may never move onto a square that is already occupied unless such a move is a legal capture.                          A player may only capture with a face-up piece of their own color, and may only capture a face-up piece of the opposing color. In all captures, the captured piece is removed from the board and its square is occupied by the capturing piece.                          The pieces are ranked, forming a hierarchy with the general at the top and soldiers at the bottom. Only pieces of equal or lower rank may be captured, with one exception. For instance, a chariot may capture a horse, and the general may capture either, but a horse cannot capture a chariot, and neither can capture the general. The one exception concerns generals and soldiers: the general cannot capture soldiers, and soldiers can capture the general.                          In the Hong Kong version, the pieces are ranked in this order: General>Chariot>Horse>Cannon, Advisor>Minster>Soldier. This ranking reflects the approximate value of the corresponding pieces in Xiangqi (though the relative rank of horse and cannon is arguable). All pieces capture exactly as they move: one square up, down, left, or right.                      The game ends when a player cannot move, and that player is the loser. Most often, the game is lost because all of a player's pieces have been captured and so he has no pieces to move. However, it is possible for one player to surround all of the other player's remaining pieces in a manner that makes it impossible for them to move.",

Captured pieces are immediately removed from the game.                          The rule for capturing allows a player to capture two enemy pieces in a single turn.

The capture is executed by placing a piece on the remaining unoccupied corner of the square. If the capturing move also simultaneously completes a second square on the board where the same conditions prevail, then the move results in the capture of four enemy pieces instead of two.

Play:             Starting with the board empty, player's take turns placing a piece of their color on an empty position that does not abut any friendly piece. If it is impossible to place a piece, the player, instead, moves a piece to the first empty position in any direction.

Ending the Game:                          The game ends at the choice of the player about to move, but only at the beginning of a turn in which there is no forced placement.                           Before scoring, the empty spaces are filled with the opponent's pieces. The player who ended the game wins unless the opponent has fewer groups.

GROUPS AND LIBERTIES:              A group is an orthogonally interconnected collection of one or more like-colored stones.              Only black groups and white groups will be discussed here, not red groups.              A liberty is an unoccupied point adjacent to a (black or white) group                          CAPTURES:             A capturing placement results in one or more groups, of either or both colors, having no liberties.              Such a placement can only be made with a red stone.              Conversely, a red stone can only be placed if it bounds (completely deprives of liberties) one or more groups of either or both colors. Red stones are permanent. They cannot themselves be captured.             Self capture is allowed.                          When multiple groups without liberties result from a placement, all such groups are removed immediately following said placement, regardless of the groups' colors. Unlike Go, if you unbound your own temporarily bounded group by removing a neighboring enemy group, you must still remove your own temporarily bounded group.                          PIE RULE:             Since Redstone is a game of annihilation, not of point score, Go’s komi can’t be used.             Instead, Redstone uses the pie rule for balance.                           OBJECT OF THE GAME:             You must annihilate your opponent, removing all of his stones from the board.

"input": "Paintscape is a game for two players – Black and White – played on the squares (cells/faces) of a square grid with 8 squares per side (e.g. a Chess board).              You also need a large supply of black and white stones and 5 distinguishable (e.g. by color) shared sets of 12 tiles. That is, each of the 5 sets contain 12 tiles, for 60 tiles in total.                          Setup:             Before play begins, all 60 tiles and 2 white and 2 black stones are distributed randomly on the 64 squares of the board.             A short balancing phase then ensues:                          One player swaps the position of any number of stones with a tile. That is, for 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 of the stones, swap its position with any tile.             When all stones have been swapped, or the swapping player passes, indicating that they do not wish to swap any more stones, the other player choses to play first as Black or second as White in the proper playing phase.             (To show the button for swapping in Ludii, you might have to click the three dots next to the pass button.)                          The balancing phase can be skipped by new players, or you can agree on a fixed setup for the 4 initial stones.                          Play:             In this phase (the proper playing phase), players take turns, starting with Black, placing stones of their own color.             On your turn, place a stone of your color on a square adjacent to one of your stones already on the board.             You may not place a stone on a square occupied by a stone. I.e. the square you place at must be empty or only occupied by a tile.             Stones placed on tiles normally just stack on top of them, however:             If a placement makes you have a stone on half of the tiles of a certain color, remove all tiles of that color along with the stones stacked on top of them (regardless of whether they're friendly or enemy).

"input": "Lifeline is a territorial strategy game for two players (Black and White) that is played on the cells of an initially empty hexhex board. The recommended board sizes are between 3 and 12 cells per side.                          Definitions:                          A group is an entire set of connected stones of the same color. A single stone, not connected to others of its color, is also a group.             A group is dead if there is no path of connected empty cells between that group and any other of its color.                          Play:                          On your turn, perform the following actions in the stated order:                          1. Place a stone of your color on an empty cell. If it is your first turn of the game, perform this action twice.             2. Remove all dead enemy groups.             3. Remove all dead friendly groups.                          The board positions at the start and at the end of your turn must be different.                          The last player to make a placement wins. Note that, after your first turn, you will always have a placement available unless you have no groups on the board.                          To make the game fair, White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with Black instead of making a regular move.                          Note that, in this implementation, the two stones you place on your first turn are only visible after both cells to place on have been selected.                          Alternative balancing methods:                          The balancing method described above is what is called 'strong pie' in the options.              This implementation also offers two other methods, for players who would like to explore alternatives.                          Weak pie: Just like with strong pie, White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with Black instead of making a regular move.             But instead of placing twice on their first move, players alternate placing one piece each (with no removals) until 4 setup stones are placed.             Consequently, White's choice will be made after Black has placed only one stone.                          Komi pie: The first player chooses a whole number of komi (between 1 and 12) and the second player chooses whether to play as White (pass) or as Black (place a stone).             The first 4 stones are placed in the same order as with weak pie (Black, White, Black, White).             Throughout the game proper, White will have the option to spend a point of komi instead of making a placement.         A point of komi is spent by clicking the shield icon next to White's name.",

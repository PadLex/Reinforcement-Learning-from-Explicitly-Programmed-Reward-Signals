Each player has one king piece, which begins in the rightmost space in the central row with respect to the player. Four six-sided dice with values from 1-6. A throw of 1 is called Chong. Pieces move in a boustrophedon path along the board, from left to right in their home row, right to left in the center row, and then left to right in their opponent's row. A player must first throw a Chong to play. On this turn, when a player throws one Chong, the King exchanges places with the soldier behind it. If more than one Chong is thrown, the King exchanges places with the soldier that many spaces behind it. Any remaining values in the throw are moved by the soldier which took the king's space. Once this move has taken place, pieces move according to the throws of the dice, which can be subdivided between the pieces as the player sees fit. The King only moves with a Chong, and it exchanges the place of a piece that number of occupied squares away, i.e., only spaces occupied by the player's pieces are counted when moving the King. When the player has only one soldier and the King, the King may move normally (like a soldier does), but on throws of Chong. When only the King is left, the first Chong in a throw is ignored and only the second, third, or fourth Chongs are moved.

The dark squares make up the house of the Dark player, and the light squares make up the house of the Light player. The goal is to empty your opponent's house. There are two types of moves in Overflow, both of which are sowing moves, somewhat akin to what you see in mancalas. All moves are bound by the restriction that there must always be exactly one orthodiagonally connected group of stacks on the board. The one kind of sowing only drops pieces onto already occupied squares and the other kind spills out of both the group of already occupied squares and out of the board itself, hence the names: contained moves and overflow moves. Sowing in general: Sowing in general is picking up a stack from any square and distributing its pieces along one of the 8 directions onto a contiguous line of squares \u2013 usually placing one of the N pieces from the chosen stack in each of the N or so squares in the sowing direction. The details are given below. Overflow moves: An overflow move involves sowing into empty squares \u2013 possibly in addition to occupied squares \u2013 and over the edge of the board. It's important to remember that these two things always go together in this game, namely (1) sowing over the edge and (2) sowing into empty squares. That is to say, if you are to sow into one or more empty squares, the number of squares in the chosen sowing direction must be smaller than the number of stones in the chosen stack. The pieces that end up outside the board are removed from the game. Contained moves: Contained moves only sow onto already occupied squares. A contained move must sow the chosen stack as far as possible. If it's impossible to sow each of the pieces in the stack into an occupied square of its own, you place the remainder of the pieces on the last occupied square you reached. You are not obligated to chose the stack that can be sown the farthest, but whatever stack you chose, if you do not make an overflow move move with it, you must chose a sowing direction that allows you to sow onto as many occupied squares as possible.

Setup Gold player places the flagship on the center square of the game board, and positions the rest of the ships anywhere within the boldly ruled central area of the board. Silver player then positions the silver ships on twenty squares in the lightly ruled peripheral area of the board. Play Gold player chooses who goes first. Players move alternately by making two moves or one capture anywhere on the board. When the flagship is moved, only one move or capture is made (thus only the flagship). Moves A player may move two of the smaller playing pieces any number of vacant squares either horizontally or vertically on the board (as a rook in Chess, except that no captures can be made with this move), although if the flagship is moved, the gold player may not move another playing piece. Captures A player may move any playing piece (including the flagship) one square diagonally to capture one of his opponent's playing pieces. (This move is similar to the capture-move of the pawn in Chess, except that captures can be made on any of the four diagonals.)

Every time a man promotes a piece is added to it, so it's stack size increases by 1. The following two-fold meaning of stack size is the key idea: 1) Odd stacks step forwards and even stacks step backwards. 2) A stack of size n can capture a piece up to n steps away in a straight line provided that there are no pieces between the capturing piece and its target, and that the square immediately behind the target in the capture direction is empty. The capturing piece must land there. Thus, the men gradually acquire the capturing power of a king in Thai Checkers as they seesaw up and down the board. There is no obligation to choose the capture sequence that maximizes the number of pieces captured. We deem this calculation a bit too demanding when a stack's range is a function of its size.

The pieces are arranged as in Chess, except the Vizier is place to the left of the Raja on both sides. Players capture pieces by moving onto a space occupied by an opponent's piece. When a pawn reaches the opposite edge of the board from where it started, it may be promoted to the more powerful piece that begins the game in that position, but only if one of these belonging to the player has already been captured. If this has not happened, the pawn cannot move to the final row. When a player can capture the opponent's Raja on the next turn, the Raja is in Check, the opponent's next move must free the Raja from check.

The board has 37 spaces. Starchess starts off with the non-Pawn pieces being placed behind the Pawns. This happens one piece at a time, in alternating turns, until all non-Pawn pieces have been placed. Then the 'movement phase' of the game begins as usual. Piece Movement: * Knights move as in Glinsky Chess. - They move two spaces in any adjacent direction, then one space in another direction. * Kings can move one space in any of those same six adjacent directions. There is no castling. * Queens can slide in any of the six adjacent directions from their current space---North, South, or 60 degrees off either of those. * Rooks can slide forward or backward only in their given column. * Bishops can slide in only four of the adjacent directions: they cannot slide North or South. * Pawns can advance one space forward without capturing. A Pawn on a Pawn start space can advance two spaces forward, even if it has previously moved (by capturing) to a different Pawn start space than it started the game on. Pawns capture by moving to one of the two adjacent spaces 60 degrees left or right of forward. On reaching the farthest rank in any of the innermost five columns, Pawns are promoted to a Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight, as the player chooses. The game ends on a checkmate or stalemate. Some terminology: a Pawn off to the side, in one of the two spaces at the extremes of the middle row is called a 'mummy', while a Pawn in one of the spaces adjacent to that is called a 'dead Pawn'. Mummies and dead Pawns cannot be promoted until they return to one of the innermost five columns.", "code": "(game \"Starchess\" (players {(player N) (player S)}) (equipment {(board (rotate 30 (hex Star 2))) (piece \"King\" Each (move Step Orthogonal (to if:(or (is In (to) (sites Empty)) (is Enemy (who at:(to)))) (apply (if (is Enemy (who at:(to))) (remove (to) (then (set Counter)))))))) (piece \"Queen\" Each (move Slide Orthogonal (to if:(is Enemy (who at:(to))) (apply (if (is Enemy (who at:(to))) (remove (to) (then (set Counter)))))))) (piece \"Rook\" Each (move Slide (directions {N S}) (to if:(is Enemy (who at:(to))) (apply (if (is Enemy (who at:(to))) (remove (to) (then (set Counter)))))))) (piece \"Bishop\" Each (move Slide (directions {WNW ENE WSW ESE}) (to if:(is Enemy (who at:(to))) (apply (if (is Enemy (who at:(to))) (remove (to) (then (set Counter)))))))) (piece \"Knight\" Each (move Leap {{F F R F} {F F L F}} (to if:(not (is Friend (who at:(to)))) (apply (if (is Enemy (who at:(to))) (remove (to) (then (set Counter)))))))) (piece \"Pawn\" Each (or {(move Step Forward (to if:(is Empty (to)))) (if (is In (from) (sites Start (piece (what at:(from))))) (move Hop Forward (between if:(is In (between) (sites Empty))) (to if:(is In (to) (sites Empty))) (then (and (set Pending (ahead (last To) Backward)) (set Var (last To)))))) (move Step (if (is Mover P1) (directions {WNW ENE}) (directions {WSW ESE})) (to if:(is Enemy (who at:(to))) (apply (remove (to))))) (move Step (if (is Mover P1) (directions {WNW ENE}) (directions {WSW ESE})) (to if:(and (is Pending) (= (to) (value Pending)))) (then (remove (var))))} (then (and (if (is In (last To) (sites Mover \"PromotionZone\")) (moveAgain)) (set Counter))))) (hand Each size:5) (regions \"Home\" P1 (sites {\"A3\" \"B3\" \"C3\" \"C2\" \"C1\"})) (regions \"Home\" P2 (sites {\"G9\" \"G8\" \"G7\" \"H7\" \"I7\"})) (regions \"PromotionZone\" P1 (sites P2 \"Home\")) (regions \"PromotionZone\" P2 (sites P1 \"Home\")) (regions \"Region-Dark\" (sites Phase 1)) (regions \"Region-Light\" (sites Phase 2)) (regions \"Region-Medium\" (sites Phase 0))}) (rules (start {(place \"King\" \"Hand\" count:1) (place \"Queen\" \"Hand\" count:1) (place \"Rook\" \"Hand\" count:1) (place \"Bishop\" \"Hand\" count:1) (place \"Knight\" \"Hand\" count:1) (place \"Pawn1\" {\"B4\" \"C4\" \"D4\" \"D3\" \"D2\"}) (place \"Pawn2\" {\"F8\" \"F7\" \"F6\" \"G6\" \"H6\"})}) phases:{(phase \"Placement\" (play (move (from (sites Occupied by:Mover container:(mover))) (to (intersection (sites Mover \"Home\") (sites Empty))))) (nextPhase (all Sites (sites Hand P2) if:(= 0 (count Cell at:(site)))) \"Movement\")) (phase \"Movement\" (play (if (is Prev Mover) (move Promote (last To) (piece {\"Queen\" \"Rook\" \"Bishop\" \"Knight\"}) Mover) (do (forEach Piece) ifAfterwards:(not (is Threatened (id \"King\" Mover)))))) (end {(if (and (is Threatened (id \"King\" Next)) (not (can Move (do (forEach Piece Next) ifAfterwards:(not (is Threatened (id \"King\" Next))))))) (result Mover Win)) (if (or (no Moves Mover) (= (counter) 100)) (result Mover Draw))}))}))"}, {"description": "8x8.

Dice are also corn kernels, with one side marked with a black dot. Four dice are used, the value of a move determined by the number of black dots that land face up. Each player has two throws on their turn, and moves after the second throw. The throws both must be used, and can be used in any order. Each team's home is the side of the board to their left. Each team moves toward the opposite end of the track, exiting at the opposing team's home. All of the players on one team play in succession, and then the players on the other team play next. Players enter the men on their throws and move along the track. Each player may have only one piece on the board at a time. When a player reaches the opposing team's home field, the piece may be re-entered on that player's team's own home field. Reaching the home field does not require an exact throw, and if one throw brings a player home, they may use the second throw to enter it again. If a piece lands on that of an opponent, it is captured. The captured piece is placed on top of the piece that captured it, and the stack continues toward the opposing team's home space.

B) If the piece is already in the largest in-line group, then move to connect that group to another.

Astralesce: Capturing every opponent's piece along the way, slide a piece to a location in-line with larger groups than the piece had been in-line with before moving.

The score is the product of warren complexity and free-space. The actual calculation depends on the board grid: see 'Options', below. Play: The player of the light stones starts by moving a single stone. Thereafter play alternates with each play performing two stone-moves on his turn. Each stone move is in one of the 6 grid directions, either -- to an empty cell surrounded by more friendly stones than before, or -- alternatively, to an empty cell surrounded by the same number of friendly stones, but fewer other neighbors. The moving stone may travel any distance, and pass over any number of stones of either player when moving. A player may pass part or all of his turn. When both players successively pass their entire turns, the game ends and is scored. The player with the higher score wins. If the scores are the same, the last player to move, loses.
